hedwig ( john cameron mitchell ) was born a boy named hansel in east berlin .
as a teen seeking his " other half , " he reluctantly agrees to a sex change operation in order to marry american g . i .
luther ( maurice dean wint ) .
the operation , performed by a hack surgeon , is botched , and the " angry inch " is all that 's left .
now a " she " , hedwig comes to america , is abandoned by luther , forms a rock band and falls for her 17-year old lover/prot ? g ? , tommy , only to be rejected by him later , too .
she and her band , the angry inch , shadows the now-famous tommy gnosis across the us ( for revenge ? ) , but hedwig is really in search of her lost other half in " hedwig and the angry inch . "
first time helmer john cameron mitchell , along with composer/lyricist stephen trask , created and starred in their acclaimed off-broadway production that has become the movie .
and quite a movie it is in its eclectic variety of songs , outrageous costumes , sets and makeup and , especially , a riveting performance by mitchell as the title character .
mitchell and trask have reinvented the movie musical and couple it with the underlying story of just whom hedwig is and what she is looking for .
i am , by far , not a big fan of musicals .
sure , there are exceptions , like bob fosse 's " all that jazz " and " cabaret , " but , for the most part , they are just not my cup of tea .
" hedwig and the angry inch " is an exception , though , with its combination of humor , wit and a collection of tunes that covers musical styles ranging from " the rocky horror picture show " and meatloaf to david bowie to the sex pistols .
the original songs , by stephen trask ( also appearing as one of the members of the band the angry inch ) , are full of energy and variety and , even though it 's not my kind of music , i found every one entertaining and fun .
the audience i saw " hedwig " with thought so , too .
the main attraction to this one-man/woman show is the presence of its star .
john cameron mitchell gives a solid , sometimes fun , sometimes angry performance as a person searching for self-enlightenment and love .
as a young boy growing up in east berlin , hansel is abused by his g . i .
father and raised by his german mother in a tiny flat so small that " mother would make me play in the oven " where he listened to pop music on armed forces radio .
later , as a young man , he meets luther , another g . i .
and is swept off of his feet .
the ensuing angry inch incident comes soon after .
flash forward to a trailer park in junction city , kansas , and luther is leaving hedwig for another boy .
frustrated and broke , she takes on baby-sitting and the odd " job " to make ends meet .
she also forms a band with four korean housewives and the musical talent of hedwig is born .
she meets , falls for and loses young tommy , who steals her songs and goes off to become a rock sensation .
jealous and angry , hedwig and her new band begins a campaign to shadow tommy 's tours and , with the help of her manager , phyllis stein ( andrea martin ) , is trying get a law suit going against the star for stealing her songs .
hedwig and the angry inch get gigs , not coincidentally , at a chain of seafood restaurants that just happen to be next to the forums where tommy gnosis is playing .
things finally come to a head , so to speak , in new york city .
the popularity of the off-broadway musical and its offshoots have garnered a ready-made audience base for " hedwig . "
the wit , humor , music and search for identity has great appeal to young adults , but the charismatic presence of mitchell makes this a cut above what it could have been .
it is this one-man/woman show that casts its spotlight on its " internationally ignored " rock star and mitchell is outstanding in the role .
there is n't a lot going on with other characters , though there are amusing little sidebars , like hedwig 's backup singer/lover , yitzak ( miriam shor ) , deciding to break away from the band to join a polynesian road show of " rent " as a puerto rican drag queen .
the low budget that the moviemakers have for the production belies the quality of the film .
attention to details - hedwig 's costumes and outrageous " cabaret " -like makeup ; the seedy trailer park setting ; and , the kitschy seafood restaurants - are loads of fun to watch and lend the appropriate air to the proceeds , all on what has to be a beer budget .
" hedwig and the angry inch " may not be for everybody , but the energy of the effort , the songs , the imaginative sets and costumes and a fast steady pace make it a pleasure to watch .
if you 're a fan of contemporary , edgy music , it is an even bigger draw .
i give it a b + .

if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia .
although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle 's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones .
until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters .
contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times .
one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin 's to live and die in l . a .
the money is n't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot .
rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected .
richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters .
however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another .
finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money .
being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier .
their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway .
like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin 's movie was inspired by real life .
gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent .
that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood .
secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie 's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan 's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times .
ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie .
willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber does n't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable .
compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their " piece of the action " , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers .
instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those " better judgement " is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end .
in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending does n't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) .
the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin 's directing skills .
the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase .
that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film .
the soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band " wang chung " , is also one of the more memorable of that decade .
in every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it .

the happy bastard 's 30-second review
big daddy
happy gilmore as a father ?
of course !
that 's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that 's passable but is n't really considered some of sandler 's best work .
he does n't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him .
he 's sonny coufax , a man who 's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) .
his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him .
enter a 5-year old kid , who 's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who 's off in china on a business trip .
from there , coufax basically acts as the kid 's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks .
he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who are n't particularly pleased with coufax 's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid .
the reason i say it 's not really sandler 's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow did n't really belong in a sandler vehicle .
i mean , it fits the movie 's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it 's just oddly placed , that 's all .
fortunately , it does n't destroy the goofy glee path it 's been following and it still makes you feel good .
sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies .
rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who ca n't read .
stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch .
look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum .
he 's a hoot .
directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with .
again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes .

slavery is bad .
after hundreds of years , we 've finally figured that one out .
this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg 's latest " serious " film .
during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa 's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery .
fifty-three of them are stuffed into the " la amistad " ( from a spanish word for " friendship " ) by their new spanish owners .
freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt .
after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think .
instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states .
the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy .
the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property .
if they are property , who do they belong to ?
their masters ?
the spanish government ?
salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ?
the us government ?
the defendants are pawns in several games .
abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause .
their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees .
south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states .
president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends .
when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes .
even that does n't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims .
at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners .
this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america 's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court .
the slavery issue is easy pickin 's for spielberg .
much like his " shindler 's list " ( which followed " jurassic park " as this follows " lost world " ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose .
nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human .
it 's not hard to see who the bad guys are .
without that question to ponder , the director 's job is more difficult .
he has to make the story interesting .
spielberg succeeds for the most part .
the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach .
where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle .
there are very few _people_ in the tale .
in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out .
tappan and joadson are " abolitionists " : symbols but not humans .
van buren is a weak politician but nothing else .
the rest of the " slaves " barely exist other than dressing for the set .
like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white .
the film 's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou .
the former model 's first major role is a winner .
without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog .
the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in " nixon " ) .
the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen .
there are some other great moments .
especially impressive are the african 's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land .
their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant .
as grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans .
more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film .
( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . )

alchemy is steeped in shades of blue .
kieslowski 's blue , that is .
with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers ' new independent film echoes the polish director 's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release .
language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character 's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm 's length .
as a result , while we 're able to appreciate the film 's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant .
alchemy is divided into three chapters : " charity " , " faith " , and " hope " .
while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) .
when the film opens , she 's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her .
following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa 's life is thrown into turmoil .
events swirls around her , and she ca n't find a source of stability .
in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend 's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a " back-to- nature " cult .
alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues .
in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art .
does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ?
are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ?
myers ' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context .
through louisa 's struggles , she succeeds .
while alchemy is n't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination .
even when we 're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there 's enough material on-screen to hold our attention .
the cinematography is stunning .
city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film 's early portions .
later , when louisa reaches the " wilderness " , we 're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground .
it 's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa 's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability .
the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use " alchemy " to provide for the needs of the body and soul .
and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it 's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace .
her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life 's ultimate goal .
even though louisa 's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it 's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch .
alchemy is n't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it 's close .

one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel .
that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century .
however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells ' novel the time machine , was n't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences .
the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour .
whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages .
instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space .
the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration .
first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own .
the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time .
at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time .
they are skeptical , but that does n't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future .
at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars .
finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions .
when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines .
but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld .
the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times .
for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie .
even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era .
compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films .
of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness .
for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today .
some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing .
but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture .
the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george 's trusted friend filby .
yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role .
however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days .

when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be " you too can believe whales can fly " .
then it was going to be " you too can believe pastel triangles can fly " .
then , it was going to be " you too can believe wood sprites can fly " .
finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . .
there 's a lot of flying going on in this film !
as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in .
well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released .
part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $ 110 , 000 in its original month of release ) .
subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) .
to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high .
in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us .
after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters .
is the format effective for the film ?
with a few exceptions , yes .
the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven 's fifth symphony .
it 's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily .
everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts .
eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things .
though this segment is n't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies .
the next segment is set to ottorino respighi 's " the pines of rome " .
in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape .
a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack .
he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the " oceans " of clouds .
again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved .
reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size .
the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images .
one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent .
absolutely beautiful stuff .
the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin 's " rhapsody in blue " .
this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york .
there 's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife .
i wo n't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending .
unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments .
segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich 's " piano concerto no . 2 " and is an animated version of hans christian andersen 's " the steadfast tin soldier " .
a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he ca n't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester .
the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina .
little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from .
the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl .
although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , " the steadfast tin soldier " is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short .
some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made .
segment five is the funniest of the bunch .
set to camille saint-saens " the carnival of the animals " , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number .
while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy .
segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it 's the one that people remember most , " the sorcerer 's apprentice " .
the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo .
unfortunately , the segment was n't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain .
there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain .
similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters .
segment seven is set to sir edward elgar 's " pomp and circumstance march no . 1 " and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character .
donald duck " stars " as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark .
during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one did n't make it on the boat .
they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners .
despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days .
powerful stuff .
segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? " saving the best for last " .
set to igor stravinsky 's " the firebird " , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape .
trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation .
when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird .
in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create .
some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) .
the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin 's clip is pretty funny .
be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin .
penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting .
the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board .
pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner 's " ride of the valkyries " , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments .
for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon .
the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material .
as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters .
i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though .
then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly .

a miracle of filmmaking , " some like it hot " is a brilliant film , and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists .
it is the pinnacle of writer-director billy wilder 's career , a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make .
jerry ( lemmon ) and joe ( curtis ) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig , trying to earn enough money to feed themselves .
one night , as they 're playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy , the place is raided .
as it turns out , the owner , spats columbo ( george raft ) was ratted out by toothpick charlie ( george e . stone ) .
several weeks later , on valentine 's day , jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage .
eager to escape , the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid .
the only catch . . its a girls band .
so josephine ( curtis ) and daphne ( lemmon ) , make their way onto the train and go to florida .
on the way there , they meet sugar kane ( monroe ) , a bombshell singer who is looking for love .
jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer , but there 's two problems : 1 ) they 're in drag , and 2 ) millionaire osgood fielding ( joe e . brown ) falls madly in love with daphne .
what follows in pure hysteria , still complicated further by the arrival of spats columbo to florida for the " italian opera lovers festival " .
tony curtis is hysterical as joe/josephine , especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar .
marilyn monroe , in a wonderfully comic performance , is sugar , providing incredible timing and sex appeal , along with true sincerity .
the scenes , however , are all stolen by either brown or lemmon .
lemmon is hysterical as daphne .
cast as the less rational one , lemmon 's performance is ridiculously crazy , it is disorder in the style all billy wilder 's .
brown is particularly hilarious as osgood , as we are treated to the finest kind of comedic irony .
he manages to use lemmon 's ingenious performance as a springboard for an even loonier performance as a completely eccentric millionaire .
every set-piece is flawless , as wilder brilliantly changes settings constantly , and uses every comic trick in the book to make his picture .
wilder 's script is stunning , as he carefully combines gangsters , cross-dressing , romance , sex , music , gender roles , and social taboos in a riotous blend of wit and oddball craziness .
wilder manages to create scenes of utter hysteria , so pitch-perfect that the audience is dying of laughter with the last comic piece , the final line of this absolutely incredible film .
wilder 's is dead wrong when he says nobody 's perfect : billy wilder is , especially when he makes something this disastrously funny .
nobody 's perfect but billy wilder .

it 's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast .
sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules .
but nothing entirely groundbreaking .
with the release of the studio 's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough 's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques .
it 's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be .
the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan 's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa .
but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib .
found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own .
we follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) .
of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero .
in tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously .
gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here .
most of the characters are amusing without being forced .
as tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture .
here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who 's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle .
of course , there 's the professor 's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie .
the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation .
directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel .
as tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave .
your eyes can barely keep up ; it 's a fantastic accomplishment .
the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average .
there are important questions raised about tarzan 's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters .
there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i was n't expecting to find here .
suffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained .
the grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the ` big mean jerk ' from ghost .
goldwyn is effective playing someone who 's not aware of his world 's dangers .
glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv 's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child .
as the movie 's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton .
it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods ' hilarious hades from hercules .
a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence .
still , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed .
i never expected rice burrough 's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth .
parents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan .

perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects .
there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise .
whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology .
the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers ' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie 's story .
unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event .
it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film 's length .
contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound .
in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp .
with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented .
the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach .
but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent .
the viewers do n't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner .
and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story .
as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind .
billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- " farms " our life energy .
only a select group of individuals knows of the " real " world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .
morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth .
the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion .
the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy .
the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles .
for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of " agents " created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather .
the casting can not be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves is n't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool .
supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual .
one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year 's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would 've worked from a different approach .
the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise .
the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun .

i know that " funnest " is n't a word .
" fun " is a noun , and therefore can not be conjugated like an adjective .
but that 's the word that came to me right after viewing " chicken run . "
no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like " that was the funnest movie i 've ever seen ! "
so to hell with webster 's -- " chicken run " is one of the funnest movies i 've seen in a while .
i ca n't remember the last time i 've seen anything funner .
the chickens at tweedy 's farm are up to something .
living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box .
one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer .
rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm 's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan .
she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , " chickens go in ; pies come out . "
what sort of pies ?
chicken pies , of course .
co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : " creature comforts , " " the wrong trousers , " and " a close shave . "
the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .
part of what made the " wallace " films brilliantly entertaining was park 's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .
" the wrong trousers , " for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and " a close shave " owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .
but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .
now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in " chicken run . "
the plot is largely lifted from " the great escape " ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .
thing is , the film does n't feel like it 's been lifted from somewhere else ; " chicken run " feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done .
part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?
park and lord milk the incongruity for all it 's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .
but they 're * chickens * , so it 's funny to us .
another thing that helps " chicken run " ( and most of park 's films ) succeed is the animators ' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they 're cribbing .
there are references to " the great escape , " obviously , and " stalag 17 . "
the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both " raiders of the lost ark " and " indiana jones and the temple of doom . "
there 's even a nod to " the blues brothers , " if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson 's nationality and film history .
the " braveheart " reference is a hoot if you catch it .
when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , " chicken run " is downright brilliant in its execution .
consider this : since july of last year , i 've seen dozens upon dozens of " blair witch project " parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .
out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .
why ?
because once you got past the thought that " they 're parodying that 'blair witch ' movie , " most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .
they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .
conversely , " chicken run " does n't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .
if you 've never seen " indiana jones , " the chase sequence is still fun .
even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .
park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it 's understood , and as a result , " chicken run " is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .
enjoyment of this movie does n't require knowledge of film history , but if you 've got it , " chicken run " is that much richer .
the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it 's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .
ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on " absolutely fabulous " ) nails it .
she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .
the characters ' inevitable romance does n't feel contrived , but sweet .
poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly is n't any help .
jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .
they even come up with an inspired riff on something that 's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .
one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of " chicken run , " it comes as a delightful surprise .
the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .
the animation is first-rate .
remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable " chicken run " really is .
this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios ' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .
as in such top-notch family fare as " a bug 's life " or " toy story 2 , " " chicken run " has something to offer in nearly every frame .
certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they 'll catch all the details .
anyway , the movie 's just a boatload of fun .
funnest damn movie i 've seen all year .

one never quite knows what one is going to get with a mamet film .
his american buffalo is a set-bound piece that has very little plot .
sometimes he will tell a story that really moves .
heist is mamet doing his most entertaining work .
unlike his the spanish prisoner , there are no lapses in credibility .
heist is probably the best mamet thriller since house of games .
it is the kind of plot with which you are never sure who will double-cross whom , and frequently it is mamet double-crossing the viewer .
watching the film 's team getting around security the viewer is frequently asking himself either " what the heck are they doing ? "
or " why did n't anybody think of that before ? "
appropriately enough heist opens with a very clever jewelry store job .
it is so clever that one wonders if mamet really thinks up all these ideas himself or if he has help from professional magician and con expert ricky jay , now a regular actor in mamet films .
this is a robbery that works like a well-oiled machine .
there is just one problem and it is enough to get joe moore ( played by gene hackman ) filmed on a security camera .
now joe has to get out of the business .
it was coming time anyway .
joe 's team including bobby blane ( delroy lindo ) , fran moor ( rebecca pidgeon ) , and pinky pincus ( ricky jay ) is going to split up and go separate ways .
but crime boss bergman ( danny devito ) is pulling the strings and he says that joe and his people have to manage one more robbery .
and he has to take along a young kid , the short- fused jimmy silk ( sam rockwell ) .
immediately it is obvious that there is more going on than meets the eye .
much of what distinguishes heist is mamet 's dialog .
remarkably it serves a double purpose .
the robbery team sounds at once very professional and at the same time it has mamet 's special feel for dialog .
hackman has lines like " everybody needs money .
that 's why they call it money . "
mamet 's timing is perfect in the direction but terrible in the production .
the plot is coincidentally a lot like the plot of the recent the score , which is , in fact , a very similar story .
both are good films , perhaps for some of the same reasons .
but at least on a high level they are much the same story .
the other problem with the timing of heist is that it involves airport security and clever ways to get around them .
i saw the film at the toronto international film festival on september 12 , 2001 .
that made the subject matter just a little too timely .
my understanding is that the release will be delayed .
my biggest problem with the film is that rebecca pidgeon 's acting at times seems very poor .
it is some kind of mamet trademark i do not understand to have women talk without inflection , as if they are just reading the words for the first time .
it is an irritation and distracts us from what is otherwise a very good thriller .
it is one i rate an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

sometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest .
some people call it " original " or " artsy " or " abstract " .
some people simply call it " trash " .
a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings .
definitely a generation-x aimed movie , a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence .
whew !
anyone in their 30 's or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film .
it 's somewhat silly , it 's somewhat outrageous , and it 's definitely not your typical romance story , but for the right audience , it works .
a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting .
well sorry folks , but i have n't seen trainspotting so i ca n't really compare .
whether that works in this film 's favor or not is beyond me .
but i do know this : ewan mcgregor , whom i had never had the pleasure of watching , definitely charmed me .
he was great !
cameron diaz 's character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp .
the audience may find it difficult to care about her , thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him .
misguided ?
you bet .
loveable ?
you bet .
a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city , utah .
this was just one more thing i did n't know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke .
maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise , but i think even if i had known , i would have been just as happy .
a life less ordinary is quirky , eccentric , and downright charming !
not for everyone , but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies .

" i know what you did last summer , " the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996 's " scream , " and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997 's biggest hit of the fall season .
while " scream " was a more knowing film about the genre , " i know what you did last summer " is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the " friday the 13th " films ( well , okay , " jason goes to hell " was pure hell to sit through ) .
the film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c .
it is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways .
kind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player .
when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home .
distraught and confused , they decide they ca n't go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him .
julie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry .
switch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out .
almost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , " i know what you did last summer , " and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook .
" i know what you did last summer , " is a successful horror film for a number of reasons .
the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings .
the characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort .
and last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i 've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family 's store with the killer inside with her .
perhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit .
heche 's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time .
" i know what you did last summer , " could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems .
prinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth .
also , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines .
luckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted " jump-in-your-seat " scare .
in the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i 've ever heard .
she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best " scream queen . "
and gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered .
although not up to the level of either " scream " movies , or the more recent , " urban legend , " " i know what you did last summer " is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made .

weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them .
in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out .
it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank .
by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants .
` seahaven ' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras .
for 30 years , truman suspects nothing- ` we accept the reality we 're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in ` fiji ' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him .
thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program .
in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through .
this allows us to comprehend and accept truman 's world before we contextualize it .
for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it .
truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed .
the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment .
cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images .
as well , it employs wojciech kilar 's piece " zycie za zycie ' masterfully and beautifully .
if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney 's characterization as meryl , truman 's " wife " ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman 's ` father ' , which feels curiously incomplete .
there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman 's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film .
they wear buttons asking ` how will it end ? '
i could n't wait to know myself , though i did n't exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years .

with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general .
hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . .
and good characters . . .
and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) .
and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth .
the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created .
now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet .
the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening .
most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering .
using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills .
unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office .
since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca .
lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca .
most people do n't even realize that it is a film .
despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it .
niccol 's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic .
gattaca begins in the 21st century .
procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it .
natural child birth is considered old-fashioned .
we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program .
one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman .
the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman .
vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love .
however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99 % chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span .
as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics .
anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns .
vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company .
labeled an " in-valid , " vincent 's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) .
german introduces him to a " valid " who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident .
jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca 's tight security .
in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship .
after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent 's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime .
irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed " valid " working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome .
gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time .
only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them .
unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried .
the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs .
the orange glow of gattaca 's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit .
the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers .
as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings are n't too far into the future .
this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day .
the best thing , however , is the plot .
the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller .
at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present .
perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring .
would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ?
maybe human nature is a result of mankind 's flaws .
if we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ?
niccol 's intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa .
the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters .
while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol 's part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story .
ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far .
his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and " valid " peers .
uma thurman is . . . well , uma thurman .
her character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story is n't about her .
however , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character .
jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character .
he provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one .
loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character .
dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie .
alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank .
still , he does a good job .
gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film .
gattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity .
despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i was n't exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty .
it turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have .
if this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently .
however , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which does n't talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) .
instead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it .
whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ?
hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca . . .
and hopefully audiences will too .
p . s . personal note to p . j . gladnick : how dare you call this film the worst film of the year .
i ca n't even begin to image what film you do like .
that frightens me beyond anything .

titanic is , without a doubt , the best movie i 've seen all year .
and believe me , i 'm not an easy critic to impress : the english patient was too long , men in black was over-hyped , and several of the " big summer releases " were dead in the water .
thank god this film got delayed until december .
it 's my christmas present .
titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years-gone-by , and it is truly a stunning film .
while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized , never taking your eyes off the screen , nor checking your watch to see how much longer it 's gon na last , despite its 3 hour plus running time .
as a friend of mine , who 's a true titanic-buff , said " if someone does n't like this film , it 's because they did n't want to . "
truer words are hard to come by .
of course , it does n't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time .
if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ?
not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it .
and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs .
it 's obvious he truly loves titanic .
the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the " heart of the ocean " , which , according to bill paxton 's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today .
their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond .
this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture .
she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond .
almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past .
rose 's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she did n't want to marry .
her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant .
they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal .
meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game .
they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving .
for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life .
for rose , she is sailing to her doom .
the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love .
it 's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches .
but as i said above , the love portion is n't sappy and does n't " weigh the film down " , as some critics have said .
it 's sweet , and it did n't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories .
of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen .
most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on .
all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch .
of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom .
the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing .
it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths .
the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future .
the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose 's story , now are totally aborbed by her .
rose goes out onto the ship 's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard .
we then see a dream of rose 's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson .
most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream .
however , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack .

this is the movie not the perfume .
a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock 's vertigo .
it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader .
set in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy .
his real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes .
upon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $ 500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed .
inspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers .
but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper 's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found .
grieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop .
sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife .
when he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife .
her name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she 's working there restoring art that is decaying .
he falls instantly in love with her and does n't heed bob 's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her .
sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him .
the surprises to come were n't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow .
it plays too much like a rehash of the master 's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way .

after watching " rat race " last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film 's 112 minutes .
saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i did n't enjoy it as much the second time as the first .
" rat race " is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness .
hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer .
the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen .
then comes the setup .
donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients .
to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines .
gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , " today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . "
the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $ 2 million in cash .
there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead .
the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money .
since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let 's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers .
decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby .
she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life .
thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature .
owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america .
an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game .
after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention .
mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america .
he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times .
pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation .
randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas .
fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview .
beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert .
brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid .
blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him .
the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal .
finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey .
at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman .
director jerry zucker ( " airplane , " " ghost " ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers .
as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps .
high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off .
had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby 's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron .
it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation .
i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence .
my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing " all star ? "
but enough carping .
" rat race " is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast .
see it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for .

john sayles ' " men with guns " is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power .
the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers .
most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists .
all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness .
however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity .
there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it .
the film 's main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category .
one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive .
fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians .
with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate .
this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea .
however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned .
as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other .
when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , " because they had guns , and we did n't . "
rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others ' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power .
dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss .
first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father .
next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities .
through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol .
along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith .
as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching .
last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who has n't spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her .
sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in " men with guns . "
( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . )
he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo .
their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film 's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo 's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes ' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is is n't ) .
the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself .
sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in " matewan " ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in " lone star " ( 1996 ) .
sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( " gattaca " ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain .
sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects .
the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border .
it would not be a stretch to say that " men with guns " is a depressing film .
in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure .
in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo 's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being .
nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly .
the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , " nobody refuses the men with guns . "

i 've noticed something lately that i 've never thought of before .
pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films .
have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ?
more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff .
i 'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad .
it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered .
somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography .
the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .
but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time .
nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .
meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we 're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive .
after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient 's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor .
he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday .
angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .
seth 's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .
the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it 's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .
cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .
it 's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .
the two are n't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual " intelligently ditzy " romantic comedy roles , and it 's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .
but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .
it 's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just did n't know quite how to get to it .
they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .
filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60 + minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .
based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending .
most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .
nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .

it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable .
somehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through .
set in the 1940 's , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) .
an orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help .
figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics .
soon homer is delivering babies like a professional .
he refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just did n't behave more responsibly .
larch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer " continues to have such high expectations of people . "
such is the result of an insulated upbringing .
though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else .
he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it .
befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived .
thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut 's wife ) a willing tutor .
tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life 's questions . . .
many of which he was unaware needed to be asked .
he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing .
michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world .
calling them " princes of maine , kings of new england " in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine .
delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins .
director lasse hallstrom ( what 's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter .
regardless of one 's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers .
the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers .
figuring the rules did n't apply to them since they did n't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along .
dr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly .
there is a danger in that line of reasoning .
god has also given us a set of rules .
unlike the list posted in the cider house , god 's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination .
and yet , many continue to ignore his " rules " preferring to make up their own as they go through life .
" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . "
proverbs 3 : 5 [ kjv ]
just as a builder follows a designer 's blueprint or a conductor follows a composer 's score , why should n't we follow the rules of life given to us by life 's architect for our own blessing ?

" i 'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , " earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher .
with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story .
he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation .
from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church .
well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion .
instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god .
and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments .
instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures .
when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss " sonny " dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson 's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves 's most powerful scene .
the body of the story starts with sonny 's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters .
with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident 's dying victims .
the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord 's work .
robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film 's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier .
rarely has a movie been such a labor of love .
with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher .
duvall has every movement down pat .
even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny can not contain his energy .
he dances and claps all the way .
sonny 's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive .
" i may be on the devil 's hit-list , but i 'm on god 's mailing list , " he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent .
and they lap it up .
people jump up , scream , " praise the lord ! "
and mean it .
the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable .
but sonny is no saint .
it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett .
jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church 's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny 's church , leaving him unemployed .
sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever .
the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( " one way road to heaven : holiness temple " ) with an enthusiastic flock .
in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church .
he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money .
and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks .
a man who ca n't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , " i quit school because i did n't like recess . "
in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she has n't seen in a while .
his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , does n't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies .
billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker .
his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show 's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take .
although it probably could n't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely .
and do n't miss the sweet epilogue during the film 's closing credits .
a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film .
the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 .
it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .

capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present .
robert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando ) .
edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime .
the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense .
, + 2 ( -4 to + 4 )
i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before .
this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens .
there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment .
there is no rock score .
there are no ballet- like martial arts .
this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script .
nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks .
if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out .
sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe .
when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game .
he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time .
he proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett ) .
she has one condition .
he must stay retired from crime .
but before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick .
nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal .
more and more details seem to complicate the job .
nick 's partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton ) .
jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates ' homes .
the young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way .
together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house .
the script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old " mission impossible " television series .
we see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of " mission impossible . "
this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise " mission impossible " films .
the complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable .
the telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be .
director frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film .
the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting .
edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today 's standards .
he plays what is nearly a double role .
jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house .
one nice ( ? )
character i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold ) .
stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother 's basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions .
he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon .
the film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist .
then the pace really picks up .
before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes .
though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown .
on the subject of music , the score of the score is by howard shore .
it adds tension to the suspense scenes , but never seems to have much of a melody .
angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break .
she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does .
speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s .
it does the job .
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) .
they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind .
you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch .
in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others .
beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones .
they live their lives in front of the television .
the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen .
this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone .
beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there .
the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television .
even at this point they have no idea what has happened .
they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television .
before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i did n't realise just how stupid .
this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film .
eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television .
luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife .
this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $ 10 , 000 if they " do his wife " .
beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $ 10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife .
they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to " do her " .
to them , this is the best day of their lives .
not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv .
inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi .
oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds .
they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc .
the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it .
at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself .
beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives .
they even get to meet the president .
but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity .
this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it 's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them .
the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude .
in the end you ca n't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television .
in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society .
if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear .
otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through .
one note of warning : do n't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you 'll
never hear the end of it !

by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard 's ransom .
gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $ 2 million .
tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi .
minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom 's house and wiring every phone .
the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you 've already seen , and it was nothing more than that .
that is until about half-way through the movie .
suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , " this is your ransom .
but this is as close as you will ever get to it .
instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . "
at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .
the last half of the film is very well done .
another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .
owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : " it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . "
before this movie , sinise played mostly " good guys , " first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 .
but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .
gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance .
although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .

every year--every year at the festival , i wait for that film to come along , that one that just pulls me out of my seat , sticks its face up next to my nose , and roars " sur-prise ! "
into my bewildered visage .
it 's almost always a surprise .
it sure as niflheim was this time .
amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason .
and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a " boy , i wish that could happen " sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash .
another e . t .
another short circuit .
this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time .
america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin ' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) .
amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it 's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama .
this is a very sturdy scenario .
the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role .
the writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the " yeah , but in real life , this would have happen " thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before !
astounding !
he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it !
i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it 's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film .
i do n't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons .
his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , " amazing " grace smith , and , well , i 'm leaving it at that because i would n't spoil this film for you for the world .
let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply .
i do n't give a rat 's ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i 'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it 's an excellent story , told with excellence .
no , i do n't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think .
the point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen .
this is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot .
it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness .
special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing 's manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is

it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of " the horse whisperer , " the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to " projection difficulties . "
robert redford 's film version of nicholas evans ' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with " titanic , " but is only now making its much anticipated debut .
this ( strategic ? )
delay has allowed " the horse whisperer " to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office .
no matter .
redford 's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron 's ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments .
whatever the reasons for its postponement , " the horse whisperer " supports the old adage " better late than never . "
redford has taken evans ' book and given it the big screen treatment .
while parts of " the horse whisperer " are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial " travelogue " that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast .
when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace 's beloved horse , pilgrim .
refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too .
undeterred by tom 's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal .
redford 's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds .
the film 's a little long and , even if you have n't read the book , it 's pretty obvious where it 's heading--but these are minor complaints .
redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it 's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role .
dianne wiest , chris cooper ( " lone star " ) , and sam neill--better than i 've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast .
and the director 's respect for horses is clearly in evidence .
one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing .
redford 's canvas is huge and exquisite .
he does n't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson 's viewfinder .
veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since " the horse whisperer " is " dances with wolves " by way of " out of africa " ( oscar winners both for barry ) .
fortunately , barry 's replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance .
" the horse whisperer " is that rare kind of movie : it looks good , it feels good , and by golly it does you good .
the wait , it turns out , was well worth it .

in one scene from " the people vs .
larry flynt , " the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally .
as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity .
the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in " patton " where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag .
both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies .
overall , that sums up " the people vs .
larry flynt . "
the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie .
the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati .
there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life .
to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine .
flynt , along with the magazine 's rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody 's real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt .
they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on " what guys really want , " explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor .
the film 's prime example of hustler 's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt 's " naughtiness . "
director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine 's frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons .
flynt 's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives .
an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law .
lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt 's wife .
norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt 's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior .
in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . )
as keating blathers about flynt 's immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $ 2 billion s&l fraud .
flynt 's other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse .
tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down .
a dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers .
flynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids .
after watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film 's climactic courtroom scene .
" the people vs , larry flynt " is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt .
" if they 'll protect a scumbag like me , then they 'll protect all of you , " declared flynt .
he 's right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons .
he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt .
harrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero .
even a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man .
an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one .
despite its flaws , " flynt " is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod .
the story may be candy-coated , but it 's still delicious candy .

capsule : a rock and roll fable , indeed .
like a hubert selby , jr . novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen , and a ton of fun .
streets of fire bills itself as " a rock and roll fable " , and the description is perfect .
this is a stylish , great-looking , and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby , jr . , novel with a damon runyan rewrite , irected by bruce springsteen .
noir is one of the few truly american movie genres , aside from the hollywood musical and the western .
this is post-wwii brooklyn noir , for lack of a better label , with a generous injection of rock 'n roll and an all-around confrontational attitude .
it all works .
the plot is simplicity itself : rocker ellen aim ( diane lane ) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang , led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven ( willem dafoe , very nasty ) .
her old soldier flame ( played by michael pare ) comes back into town to save her , but does n't count on a whole bunch of things going askew .
that 's about the entire plot , save for the spats with ellen 's manager ( a hilarious rick moranis ) , an encounter with a doo-wop group that winds up becoming ellen 's supporting act , and a whole gang of other fun little touches .
but in movies like this , when is the plot important ?
the movie is all style , all visuals and attitudes , quotable lines and posturing -- and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing .
no surprise that it was directed by walter hill ( 48 hrs . ) , who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly , and has put together a movie that 's a mixture of times and sensibilities , but perfectly unified in tone .
when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie , especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw ( * and * passes out ) every 2 . 63 minutes on cue ?
streets of fire is n't the greatest movie ever made , but it occupies a totally unique little niche , and enjoys the position it has .
anyone with a weakness for doo-wop , neon , motorcycles , rainy streets , the el , studebakers , gang pictures , lonely heroes , and a great-looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up .
i did .

the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form .
it 's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre .
what makes " peter 's friends " so remarkable is not how it does n't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i would n't mind hanging with .
what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ?
well . . . .
1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother .
2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis .
3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart .
4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 .
5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic .
6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they 're friends .
7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited .
8 . eightly , they 're all unhappy or marginally so .
9 . there 's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that 's built up over the years .
10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so .
11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song .
since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a " british 'big chill . ' "
and in some ways it is .
both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships .
but while " the big chill " was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , " peter 's friends " hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant .
the friends of peter 's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) .
after peter 's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it .
not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums .
of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule .
andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who 's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) .
maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy .
roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in " sense and sensibility " ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died .
and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who 's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts .
as for peter , things seem okay . . .
the film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i 've done lots of theatre myself ) .
and there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) .
the final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did .
maybe it 's because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique .
that 's really what makes " peter 's friends " so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone 's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another .
it 's when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends .
not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s .
there are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears " everybody wants to rule the world , " but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i 'd put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old " come on eileen " ) , but this is the british 80s we 're talking about .
oh well .
but anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing .
branagh 's forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he 's very good with making a less ambiguous film like this .
the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , " no , but we have hollywood " - punishment like that ) .
the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter 's mansion .
a little note should be made about hugh laurie 's performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i 've never seen him actually act this dramatically .
" peter 's friends " is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i do n't know what kind i 'll have ( like most people , i do n't look forward to my high school reunion ) .
because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that .

the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola 's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .
martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .
unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola 's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .
seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .
this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .
goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .
the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .
at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .
after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .
three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .
wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .
but the perfect world of " wiseguys " gradually begins to fall apart - tommy 's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy 's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry 's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .
goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .
scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .
world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .
scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .
after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .
scorsese also manages to break viewer 's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .
with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character 's dialogue or narrator 's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .
even if we do n't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .
first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie 's ironic prologue .
then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .
this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .
same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .
nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .
but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .
however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .
such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .
fragmentary character of the screenplay , which does n't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .
he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious " a day in life " segment near the end of the film .
another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .
the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .
joe pesci deserved his " oscar " for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .
ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps does n't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .
liotta 's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .
liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .
lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .
paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .
as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .
because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .

imagine this .
you 're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training .
a man you do n't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live .
you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die .
you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you .
you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood .
if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you 're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow .
eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you 're going to die .
this is the life of a gladiator .
you 'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott 's powerful gladiator , you 'll be thankful for that .
with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire .
and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script .
since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited .
> from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious .
rome 's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania .
scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective .
it 's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted .
as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who .
it 's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch .
instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle .
he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life .
but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that .
the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies .
he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators .
all of this does not go well for aurelius ' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor .
jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus ' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus .
but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius ' wishes .
now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success .
a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick .
you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way .
phoenix plays his character brilliantly .
think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , " respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man " brat who hates when he 's not the center of attention .
every scene we see commodus , he 's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying .
phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he 's more than just river 's little brother .
crowe is also excellent as the film 's grisly-faced hero .
maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions .
this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he 's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being !
the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate .
ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general .
the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 .
the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians .
gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience .
along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 .

modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo 's original tome .
adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen .
liam neeson stars as jean valjean .
as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes .
prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor .
however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man .
however , he runs up against one man who does n't believe in reform .
inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider .
he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions .
he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice .
two women also get caught up in the struggle .
fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society .
her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she can not afford to raise her .
instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave .
director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo 's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book .
hopefully you wo n't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went .
the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes .
the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles .
neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past .
the supporting cast is also extraordinary .
the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius .
the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film .
the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length .
while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation .
it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing .

truman ( " true-man " ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey 's character in this film .
president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature .
" truman " also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans .
and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc .
if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv 's world , the world where our protagonist lives .
combine all these names and concepts into " truman burbank , " and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world .
truman leads the perfect life .
his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect .
his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky .
the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart .
.
.
but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ?
the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements .
he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian .
when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully .
his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities .
the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator .
the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks .
a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place .
two security guards grab him and throw him out .
truman is really suspicious now .
it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge .
" it 's best not to think about it , " she says , trying vainly to change truman 's memory .
truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense .
at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town .
his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world .
you know by now that truman 's life is the subject of a television program .
his actions are " real " but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife .
truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is .
meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman 's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy .
it 's sort of like westworld told from the robots ' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs ' point of view .
we root for the captive of the cage-world .
our protagonist is counting on " chaos theory " to help him escape his elaborate trap .
the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake .
although these questions came to mind , i do n't think the film itself asked them .
it certainly did n't address them or try to answer them .
i was particularly disappointed that the film did n't deal more with the trauma of learning one 's life is a tv show .
carrey 's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman 's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film 's pacing .
earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well .
the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol did n't see it that way .
perhaps it 's not fair to criticize a movie for what it is n't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here .
but on its own terms , the movie is well made .
sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently .
much of the first part of the movie is the truman show .
the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen .
one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen .
the music is well-chosen and scored .
the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman 's world is still beautiful and perfect .
when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre .
philip glass ' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman 's scenes of suspicion and awakening .
( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . )
and the pacing of the story was brisk .
there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie .
one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman 's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it was n't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner .
there 's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down .
it 's a quick , straight shot to the movie 's end .
in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol 's gattaca .
both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds .
but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film " clicked " and became an instant classic .
nevertheless , i look forward to niccol 's next film , whatever it may be .

let 's face it : since waterworld floated by , the summer movie season has grown * very * stale .
with no new eye-candy for four weeks straight , we 've had to sustain ourselves on the quasi-nutritional value of cheatin ' husbands , traveling chocolate salesmen , and computer- generated serial killers .
sigh .
thank god for desperado .
the freewheeling sequel to el mariachi--director robert rodriguez 's notorious $ 7000 debut--stars a cool antonio banderas as the returning guitarist with no name .
he 's a man in black with revenge on his mind , and an arsenal in his case .
( the woman he loved was killed in the first film . )
so , he spends the entire story shooting drug dealers ; sort of a tex-mex version of the punisher , if you will .
there is n't much of an emotional core to desperado .
rodriguez is having too much fun finding new and innovative ways to pay homage to john woo .
( and sergio leone . . .
and sam peckinpah . . . )
some may wince at the body count--at least 100 graphic killings is a fair estimate--but it 's all played for laughs .
big , broad , hispanic laughs that , for me , recall the physical comedy of blake edwards and his pink panther films .
sick , slick fun .

well , i 'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante 's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister ' had started .
so now it seems that we 're in a full fledged return to the '70 's disaster film era .
with 'twister ' , 'dante 's peak ' , 'volcano ' and soon 'flood ' and james cameron 's extremly expensive 'titanic '
i 'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano ' much more than i did 'dantes peak ' .
part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in .
i 've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy ' or 'hokey ' and really did n't see or think that once during the entire film .
i get bored easily and this film did n't bore me for a minute .
another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about " well thats not really possible . "
you know what ?
i could n't give a bloody damn if it 's possible or not , really i could n't .
it 's a freaking movie and i do n't want reality thrown in my face .
i want to be able to see the impossible , the all might " what if " to many reviewers have seen one to many movies !
the special effects are the second star to this feature .
they are so amazing that i found it hard sometimes to believe they were indeed fx and la was was not burning to the ground .
they did an incredible job and come oscar time ( if they remember ) some notice better be thrown there way .

studio expectations must not have been high for " great expectations " -- the film 's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 .
it 's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale is n't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year .
" great expectations " also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann 's " william shakespeare 's romeo + juliet . "
" great expectations " opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future .
there 's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn 's ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella 's auntie who 's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of .
finn , who lives with his sister 's affable boyfriend ( lone star 's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor 's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion .
flash forward into the '90s ( after a brief stop in the '80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it 's enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art .
there , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world .
when estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction .
but she 's not the only ghost from finn 's past that 's going to be paying him a visit .
comparisons with the afore-mentioned " romeo + juliet " seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting .
" great expectations " is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where " romeo " was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both .
the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki 's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that 's steamier than the film 's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes .
the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik .
acting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay 's occasional slip-ups .
hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from " gattaca " ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy .
paltrow 's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped .
while the actress is at her icily seductive best , we 're not told very much about her character , and as a result , it 's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we do n't quite understand why she 's fueling his fire .
robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous .
alfonso cuaron 's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie 's climax .
another problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you are n't familiar with the story .
despite its script flaws , though , " great expectations " is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy .
and frankly , it 's nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality .
perhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine 's day , will end up helping " great expectations " ' seemingly average box office chances after all .

" no man is an island , " one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie 's themes .
while hardly a great film , singer 's ambitious adaptation of king 's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it .
apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses .
1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again .
bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd 's theory .
bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden 's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view .
the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd 's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion .
bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii .
marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his " student " , among other things .
bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship .
dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future .
all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material 's excessive climax .
singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system .
his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal 's tics and todd 's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals .
apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway .
thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects ' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system .
some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer 's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training .
mckellan 's and renfro 's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan 's finely-tuned realization , i 'd like to single out renfro 's daring work .
he is n't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers would n't do .
( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? )
renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he does n't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him .
as guidance counsellor edward french , " friend " schwimmer also deserves mention .
he wants to be the parent to todd that todd 's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil 's blackening-heart even more apparent .
but one of the film 's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous .
no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the " right " or the " wrong " choices .
schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible .
-october , 1998
* the excellent collection king 's stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) .

when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies .
from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they 're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( do n't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say " i 'll be right back , " etc . ) .
when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie .
how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies .
was this wes craven 's remedy from making " real " bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ?
it just seemed cheap to me .
then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude .
scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it 's also a pretty scary movie .
if you 've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen .
this is part of the fun of watching scream .
the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers .
to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film .
there 's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though .
i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics .
their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive .
from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories .
films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream .
the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990 's .
this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson 's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors .
scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson .
within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie .
mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you 're dead meat ) .
not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors .
the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction .
in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience 's satisfaction and amusement .
i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies .
i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream 's perfect subtlety .
however my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . .
so who knows .

the happy bastard 's 30-second review
notting hill
a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral , notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott , a very popular actress with a $ 15 million asking price for movies .
one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident ( played by hugh grant ) , and sparks somehow begin to fly .
sure , there are points of turmoil , such as putting up with grant 's slightly disgusting ( but very hilarious ) roommate spike , anna 's pesky ex-boyfriend ( alec baldwin in a humorous cameo ) , and , on top of all that , those damn press .
it 's a fresh sort of complexity to see in a romantic comedy , very different from , say , a stubborn father or " not the right time " like as seen in usual flicks .
roberts is terrific as the astonishingly beautiful actress , and grant is surprisingly good as the straightforward guy still trying to get a hold of what has actually happened with this girl .
in short , a sweet romantic comedy that has a lot of good laughs , particularly provided by spike .
one tee-shirt really says it all about him .
in an attempt to turn on a woman , he shows the front of the shirt , which says : " you are the most beautiful woman in the world . "
on the back ?
" fancy a f * * k ? "

the last steve martin film i saw , the spanish prisoner , was a very different approach for the comic actor .
as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob " a process " from a clueless businessman , martin 's character did it all for money .
in his most recent movie , bowfinger , martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry .
he wants to direct a successful picture that will force people to remember his name , that will make him more popular at the parties , and , most importantly , that will cause fed ex to deliver important business packages to his front door .
playing the title role , martin is once again the good guy ; the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie .
this con man is very likeable for some reason , even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner .
maybe the message is that , in hollywood , to win over the trust and friendship of others , you have to be a little evil .
bowfinger is a very clever comedy with great performances from its two stars .
martin , who also wrote the screenplay , is perfect as a jerk with a conscience and eddie murphy does his best " peter sellers " in two different , but equally hilarious , roles ; one as a big time move star and the other as his nerdy , burger king employee brother .
the story follows aging and failing director/producer bobby bowfinger as he makes one last attempt to become a respected member of his field by creating a b-action movie called chubby rain .
in order to attract actors and crew members , bowfinger promises them that hot shot actor kit ramsey will star in the movie .
the only problem is that kit refuses to be in it .
but this wo n't stop the aggressive bowfinger .
he is so determined to complete his film that he decides to put kit in it without even telling him .
he has his actors approach kit on the streets of los angeles in character with a hidden camera filming the footage .
will bowfinger be able to make his film ?
or will kit ramsey discover what exactly is going on ?
bowfinger is a very cartoon-like movie that pokes fun at hollywood and its famous residents while simultaneously holding a very solid story line .
the only area where the film really lacks is the cameo department .
this is the kind of movie that cameos are all about , it is always funny to see actors/directors/producers making fun of themselves or co-workers especially in a playful movie such as this .
besides the very repetitive and superflous ending , bowfinger is a joy to watch .
if you take a movie like this seriously then you will never enjoy it .
if you accept the incredulous plot and the extreme caricatures of real entertainment figures , the movie is great fun .

an indian runner was more than a courier .
he * became * the message he was carrying .
what danger is a bear , to a message ?
i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna-marrying , loudmouth .
but all that has changed now .
the guy has grown up .
and that 's not all .
it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication .
one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper .
but , no .
this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple .
penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash .
the focus of the story is two brothers .
david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer .
viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he ca n't name , much less resolve .
the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line .
it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared .
the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere .
it is n't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them .
life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems .
this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face .
in fact , i 'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing .
there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw .
i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free-form sections which also work very well .
the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do--this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all .
in my opinion , it is worth full-price admission .

it is often said by his fans that hal hartley movies are an acquired taste .
indeed .
while perhaps less dangerous than tequila shooters or bungee-jumping , they require no less amount of physical stamina and concentration .
i felt rewarded at the end of henry fool ; this movie creeps up on you-at a slow 139 minutes , i mean creeps-and despite the final shot 's ambiguity , i left completely satisfied .
henry fool ( " used to have an ? e ' " ) arrives at garbageman simon grim 's house , claims the vacant basement apartment , and almost instantly inspires simon ( urbaniak ) to take up writing-henry ( martin donovan look-alike ryan ) is an ex-convict , a once-great author who has been " exiled and marginalized " by the publishing community because of his criminal activity .
simon 's poetry turns him into a local sensation , as it causes mute women to sing , high-school girls to swoon , and councilmen to rile against its " pornographic " content .
meanwhile , henry seduces both simon 's dependent mother ( porter ) and immature sister ( sundance queen posey ) with philosophical babble ( which is by turns brilliant and inane ) and breathy animal lust .
these story elements result in climaxes both inevitable and unpredictable ; the teacher-student relationship formed between henry and simon eventually reverses itself .
henry fool is sprinkled with hartley-ian flourishes : simon drinks milk from " udderley 's " ; the big teen hang-out is called " world of donuts " ; simon wears his garbageman 's uniform throughout ; the editing style is decidedly elliptical . . .
( which is key to the conclusion 's said ambiguity ) .
the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously " quirky " ; the introductory scenes are a chore .
these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they are n't pop slackers .
the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of .
( shades of film school . . . )
the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one 's patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length .
how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character .
and unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded .
this , hartley 's seventh feature , is contemplative about " the artist " ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon 's work , and it 's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers ' pens .

the happy bastard 's quick movie review
analyze this
how does one do a comedy focused on the mob ?
well , a few years ago , there was a sly little comedy called the freshman , which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send-up of his famous don corleone character and , recently , the utterly stupid ( in a bad way ) movie mafia !
failed to really get the joke .
this time around , however , warner bros . may have gotten it right with analyze this , a movie that hits its targets more than it misses . . . and
for plenty of reasons .
the story goes like this .
a mobster ( robert deniro ) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late , fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near-death following a drive-by shooting .
it 's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist ( billy crystal ) who 's mostly reluctant to take the mobster 's case for two reasons .
first , of course , he 's a mobster , but secondly , he 's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife ( lisa kudrow ) and kid .
and , of course , he ca n't rest worth for a moment because the mobster 's goons are always needing the shrink for something , be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation .
fortunately , the movie is played out for plenty of laughs .
director harold ramis ( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity , which was n't half bad ) keeps the tone peppy and light , even if it 's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments ( shootings ca n't always be taken for laughs , you know ) .
deniro does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy , giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas , but with a bit of a lighter heart .
( a scene where he tries to display his anger over the phone and fails miserably is hilarious . )
crystal plays an excellent straight man to deniro 's character , uplifting him from such bombs as father 's day and my giant .
kudrow is also a hoot as crystal 's wife-to-be , who 's on the verge of a breakdown thanks to deniro 's presence .
is the movie perfect ?
not really , thanks to a simplistic ending and some slightly wasted moments with a character portrayed by chazz palminteri ( he 's a comic actor , too , come on , give him some more ! ) , but it is an enjoyable romp that lets deniro do something different but same for a change , taking his dramatic act to a new field of comedy .
kudos to crystal and kudrow for not just making it his show , either .
line of the movie : crystal : " when you said you needed family therapy , this is not the family i had in mind ! "

a common complaint amongst film critics is " why are n't there more literate scripts available ? "
quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing is n't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content .
paul attanasio 's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors .
the film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g .
a '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed .
deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script .
redford departs from the usually overlight , " cable tv quality " sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces .
quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years .
although i was only 4 years old when the " twenty one " scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford 's almost tangible palette .
from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without " disposable income , " before the manifestation of its american dream .
the film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from " the good life , " to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father 's fame .
though the 50s audience that is " rocked " by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding .
charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day .
the tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf .
at the film 's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff .
like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this " mirror " may reflect an image we 're not all that comfortable with .

titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it 's upsetting that it is n't .
the film , which cost $ 200 million + to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk ' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film .
we all know that big budget dose n't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic .
but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron 's best films )
the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic .
they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman .
the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her .
the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic .
in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america .
also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dose n't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich .
she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them .
oh yeah , and the ship sinks .
and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius .
the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak .
the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat wo n't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it 's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film .
without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear .
firstly , there 's cameron 's direction .
there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic .
but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end .
there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron .
it 's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below .
thanks to cameron 's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes .
to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters .
dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old .
his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines .
winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth .
zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash .
the audience really does come to hate him .
he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he 's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well .
also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american .
finally , the icing on the 'great things ' cake are the special effects .
cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout .
the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , can not animate human movement too well .
the humans seem to move to 'smoothly ' , there 's just something odd about them .
you can tell that they have been animated on a computer .
of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed .
titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film .
titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story .
again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts .
titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius .
enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound .
a superb film , but sadly not perfect .
overall rating = (

go 's is a gloriously slick hip machine .
director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them .
after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending .
this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) did n't arrive .
a la tarantino 's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories .
the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough .
her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas .
zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust .
perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino 's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ;
pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go 's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last .
torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was " not pleased with " her turn as the ill-fated cashier .
in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date .
here 's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you .
if she does n't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said " no , " not go .
but i digress .
go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one ca n't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride .
in that sense , it 's a departure from liman 's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan 's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story 's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald 's for their latest commercial ) .
i wish i cared more about go 's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous .
when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me .
yet entertain me it did .
go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs .
fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go .
unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .

whenever studio executives try to combine the successful formula of two blockbuster films , the end result is always a mess of a script , acting , directing , and generally a waste of time for any audience with an average iq above 40 .
the latest movie morass from hollywood , the crew , appeared equally destined to fail , a strange combination of grumpy old men and goodfellas tossed together with the likes of richard dreyfuss and burt reynolds helming the ship .
the scary thing is that it 's actually entertaining and a breath of fresh air in this otherwise stale month .
the crew works for several reasons .
the clever script is reminiscent of an old billy wilder movie , following four " past their prime " wiseguys from jersey who now live in the raj mahal apartment house in miami beach .
the wiseguys find themselves being evicted from their " golden paradise " by greedy landlords bent on raising rents for new beach bunnies and boys looking for beachfront property .
the four mobsters , bobby bartellemeo ( richard dreyfuss ) , joey " bats " pistella ( burt reynolds ) , mike " the brick " donatelli ( dan hedaya ) , and tony " mouth " donato ( seymour cassel ) decide to hatch a scheme to plant there a dead body heisted from the morgue in order to drive out the new tenants and keep their home .
this " simple plan " suddenly goes screwy , of course , and the boys become involved with a stripper named ferris ( jennifer tilly ) who wants her stepmother killed , a paranoid latin drug lord who 's convinced a mysterious rival is out to get him , and a rat with its tail on fire .
the crew works as a strong comedic vehicle driven by a great ensemble cast of talented character actors and subtle leading men .
instead of concentrating on bobby 's search for his daughter , the film gives equal screen time to all four wiseguys , balancing the production .
the acting talents of such screen veterans as dan hedaya , seymour cassel , and the great , great burt reynolds are brought out by each character 's uniqueness and synergy within the wiseguy circle .
a strong supporting cast including jeremy piven as a philandering boyfriend/cop/partner and miguel sandoval as the paranoid drug lord provide the most laughs .
the film was produced by barry sonnenfeld and carries a hint get shorty with its energetic camera work by michael dinner , emmy award-winning director of the wonder years .
the quick script written by barry fanaro , screenwriter of kingpin , is carried by plenty of subtly dry humor and wit .
the crew is a prime example of how simple and dry-witted a comedy can get these days .
the great thing is that this comedy does not need to be punctuated by bodily fluids , phallus symbols in the head , or grandmothers giving head in a spa .
in the steady flow of " extreme " comedy these days flowing from hollywood like a broken water main , it 's the elder statesmen like dreyfuss , reynolds , and hedaya that can carry a comic arc with only a few weapons of choice - a decent script and good acting .

natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree .
both films glamorize " outlaws , " in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers .
both relate the story of a couple liberated by love .
but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant .
where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological .
what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores .
what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill .
to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields .
for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed .
this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity .
brahma created .
vishnu preserved .
and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma .
the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i 'm forced to say it for clarity 's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics .
your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers .
i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena .
muslims kill christians .
hindus kill muslims .
christians kill pagans .
jews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged .
religion is an orgy of killing .
the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it has n't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable .
" the state is the divine idea upon earth , " hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc .
well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ?
let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex .
consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever .
god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other .
during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power .
( parenthetically , witness plato as well .
in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime .
not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . )
catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil .
it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure .
masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution .
this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence .
as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters .
our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years .
we ca n't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self .
mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves .
it is a straightforward liberation through sex .
as some good patriarch once observed , " you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . "
m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions .
they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions .
" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , " as mickey says .
as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face .
we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is .
" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans " : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us .
beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . .
we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth .
who else has found it ? --the
man of today ? -- " i
do n't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever does n't know either the way out or the way in " --so sighs the man of today . . . .
this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay .
this tolerance and largeur of the heart that " forgives " everything because it " understands " everything is a sirocco to us .
rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds !
as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say .
its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure .
for example wayne gayle 's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , " if i were a mass murderer i 'd be mickey and mallory , " in his most excellent bill and ted voice .
on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes .
it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he 'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it .
let me exemplify what i 've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her " the worst fuckin ' head i 've ever had in my life ! ! ! "
now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they did n't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this .
sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever .
it 's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey .
as the attendant approached he took on mickey 's character in the eyes of mallory .
she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory .
upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else .
the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i wo n't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power .
let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle .
the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood .
also , jungian archetypes abound .
these ca n't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames .
some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) :
mickey to mallory : " one of these days i 'm gon na be cummin ' for you , " in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off .
semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come .
at the time they have n't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet .
the two of course go hand in hand .
for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs .
mickey during his marriage to mallory : " as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife . "
the way woody delivers this line is truly haunting , but telling , too .
it reveals m&m are well on their way to expunging all their destructive tendencies and replacing them with positive ones .
this is what mickey means by " creator of my universe , " he is giving himself or creating for himself healthy attitudes .
it is not necessarily a schizophrenic retreat into solipsism as it first appears .
scagnetti 's first meeting with mallory is through her pubic hair he plucks from the gas station attendant 's mouth .
the indian sage releasing mallory 's father , who was reincarnated as a snake : " old man , go be a snake , " after telling his " snake story " that ends with " bitch , you knew i was a snake . "
after mickey shoots this sage to death during a bewildering nightmare , mallory says , " you killed life ! ! ! "
this is another telling quote because it implies they did n't see themselves as killers of life .
then what were they killing up to that time ?
in some case just those zombies faking their way through life , the living dead , as it were .
in other cases , all the anti-life forces , the cops and their parents .
the butterfly just before the movie shifts into the prison .
it of course symbolizes rebirth .
dr . emil reingold , as portrayed by steven wright , passing judgement on m&m : " mickey and mallory know the difference between right and wrong , they just do n't give a damn . "
this is reminiscent of nietzsche 's whole philosophy , and maybe a direct reference to his beyond good and evil .
mickey : " the rabbit says the moment of realization is worth 1000 prayers . "
mickey ( again in his interview ) : " me and you , we are not the same species . "
notice when the escape is in progress we get some role reversals in terms of leadership and control .
mickey the prisoner becomes the leader of his little gang .
the wardens become prisoners and the civilians like wayne gayle and his producer follow the leader , no matter who it is .
mickey : how ya feelin ' ?
wayne : fucking great !
mickey : you got the feelin ' ?
wayne : i 'm alive .
i 'm alive for the first fuckin ' time !
what an incredible transformation this is .
he got the feeling and he could n't contain himself .
what a feeling .
that feeling of metaphysical freedom that you can create your own universe .
mickey when almost caught in a dead end , " think , think , think , think . "
go figure it out .
dwight ( tommy lee jones ) in general , because he may be the sickest fuck in the whole film .
his whole attitude can be summed up with , " destroy them ! ! ! "

andrew lloyd webber 's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .
webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as " oklahoma ! , " or the slapstickness of shows like " a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . "
they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics .
like " jesus christ superstar , " which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune " superstar , " a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he did n't spread his message wider ) , " evita " takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) .
" evita " deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it was n't like di slept to " the top " ) .
webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it .
here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad .
it 's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung .
the film plays like a rock opera , much like their " jesus christ superstar , " with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one .
after all , this is a musical , and webber 's musicals never undermine this .
they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side .
this is why the beginning of " evita " is kind of a let-down .
okay , it is a let-down .
i 'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they 're pretty good .
but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand .
in the musical , it 's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , " buenos aires , " which is also lifeless .
then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , " another suitcase in another hall , " which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva .
the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it 's being narrated by a hater of eva 's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light .
for a while , it looks like alan parker ca n't pull it off .
however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song " goodbye and thank you , " where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful .
from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical .
no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .
we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .
more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work .
juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .
a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before .
> from the " goodbye and thank you " number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation 's people downtrodden .
but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star .
that 's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she was n't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame .
describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he 's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective ca n't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .
alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he 's done " fame , " " the committments , " " bugsy malone , " and " pink floyd the wall " - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is .
we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented .
his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .
and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings " do n't cry for me , argentina , " and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .
madonna 's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film .
at the beginning , she looks like she 's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .
her death , though , is brilliant .
her singing could be better though .
i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she 's trying to hard .
she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti
lupone - i heard her sing on an old " evita " cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .
but it 's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .
antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i 'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator .
his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin .
he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range .
and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .
although it gets off to a rocky start ( " rocky " 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .
like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen 's " everyone says i love you " ) , it 's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .

in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone 's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses .
wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman .
stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange .
critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic .
i 'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them .
i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone 's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen .
stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) .
this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions .
he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane .
it 's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like .
i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top .
these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges .
more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street .
the only possible solution i can muster is its release date .
and not just the timeliness of the " greed is good " subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies .
in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes .
maybe stone 's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace .
boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone 's piece of crap .
they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room 's is much more subtle and touching .
and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street .
boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) does n't shove it in our faces .
boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash .
as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that has n't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires !
in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it " all " .
and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it " all " the easy way .
he 's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him .
ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko .
his job is to influence trainee 's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood .
it 's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they 're told to dish out to prospective buyers .
affleck 's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin 's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor 's performance .
affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge .
when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own .
by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading .
the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game .
rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters .
they are n't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes .
we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be .
as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness .
i know this story .
we all do .
but it can work if it 's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it .
as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn .
his style is sitcom bland .
but his writing is n't .
younger 's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet .
despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script .
the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock .
these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who is n't aware that he is one .
with the exception of affleck 's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional .
ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth .
he conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things are n't going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he 's ferociously cut throat .
the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it 's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) .
boiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys .
those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth 's friend and his mentor .
diesl shines in his minor role .
this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner .
in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80 's , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70 's .
nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he ca n't have .
nia long , as the firm 's secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi 's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting .
the two make an oddly likeable couple .
long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof .
at one point he says to her " i 'm just lookin ' for some chocolate love " .
it 's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing .
unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy .
there is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares .
this is okay when taken in small doses , but younger 's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other .
a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth 's manipulations have on one of his poor victims .
it 's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message .
that message being , " greed is bad " .
yes it 's patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i have n't seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur .
and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners .
boiler room offers neither extreme .
it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful .

buffalo ? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci .
gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling .
once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married .
the truth is he is n't married .
to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife .
the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you do n't need money to make a good film .
buffalo ? 66 does n't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events .
gallo 's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals .
the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits .
gallo and ricci arrive at his parent 's house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house .
ricci 's performance during the scene at gallo 's parent 's home are very well done .
there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes .
the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative .
they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine .
gallo 's character is developed very well .
the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear .
gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through .
his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life .
this character seemed very realistic to me .
ricci 's character is funny and different .
she does n't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her !
ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves .
buffalo ? 66 is n't all laughs though .
many scenes are very dramatic and depressing .
gallo 's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing .
some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life .
the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material .
i really would have liked to see gallo 's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more .
overall , buffalo ? 66 is n't as good as some people put it up to be .
the bottom line- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .

the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year .
we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office .
this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy .
i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them .
that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza .
in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell .
he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra .
evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable .
rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that 's why she chose him to lead her there .
also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn 's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) .
now in hamunaptra , the three uncover " the book of the dead . "
the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book .
along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra .
not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt .
do n't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time .
this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers .
on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that 's up to you to decide .
there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though .
the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world .
we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human 's skin .
these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy .
as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country .
in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles .
when playing " george " in disney 's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone .
i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens .
in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle .
although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast .
weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film .
the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time .
evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah 's , did n't get much personal attention .
in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part .
in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works .
there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work .
the mummy could have gotten an " a " rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these .
i did n't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them .
the cinematography is amazing in the mummy .
particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians .
the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography .
from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch .
the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .

those print and television ads trumpeting that " 'grease ' is still the word " are right on the money .
to celebrate its 20th anniversary , this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like " star wars " -- a well-deserved , red-carpet rerelease .
that 's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ?
or the hard-nosed principal ( eve arden ) reminding the student body to " be an athletic supporter " by rooting for the home team ?
or national bandstand emcee vince fontaine ( edd byrnes ) flirting with marty ( a pre- " empty nest " dinah manhoff ) ?
and these are all probably considered minor moments . . .
a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton-john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson , and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom 's most effervescently charming .
for those eight of you who are n't familiar with the story , here 's a brief recap : greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer ; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started , but both were wrong .
sandy tries to rekindle their relationship , but danny 's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t-bird buddies ( including jeff conaway ) .
so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies , headed by sassy , sexy rizzo ( stockard channing , just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time ) -- and danny , who still really feels love for her , attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back .
the drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of " greased lightening , " the film 's big " guy " number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but " grease " 's flaws amount too few to carp .
the movie 's first showpiece is " summer nights , " where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance .
not only is " nights " tremendously catchy , but it 's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes .
there has yet to be a live-action musical sequence that rivals the one-two punch of " you 're the one that i want " and " we go together , " " grease " 's euphoric cappers .
all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated " hopelessly devoted to you " is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing 's lamenting ballad " there are worse things i could do " is one of " grease " 's most unjustly overlooked tunes .
the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of " nights " ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos .
and it 's a testament to " grease " 's timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it 's the same all-around blast it 's always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music .
to '90s viewers , " grease " will probably recall disco and bellbottoms as much as it made its original audience nostalgic for doo-wop and poodle skirts .
but regardless of what decade it transports us to , we can all agree on one thing -- without a doubt , " grease " is still the word .

an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material .
the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .
instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice .
upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she 'll be home in a few days .
of course , that does n't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .
in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .
rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .
i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .
but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .
ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .
throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz 's character .
the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .
director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .
the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress wo n't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .
the reason ?
mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .
the novice detective 's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .
unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips ' cheery tone .
rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .
it 's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .
several details in fernando 's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .
early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .
after that , fernando 's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando 's stormy past .
it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that does n't need any .
but there are n't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .
the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we 'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .
or if our passports were n't missing .

usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock .
others will mention meg ryan .
but for me , it 's not even close .
janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now .
and it 's a good thing she 's starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull .
garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls .
in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory 's that never moved to america .
unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town 's annual matchmaking festival .
things get off to a rocky start for marcy though .
she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche ' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub .
his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed .
the movie runs into a few roadblocks .
for instance , the story is very thin .
none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo .
some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie .
i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo 's winning smile .
the strange thing is that it works .
garofalo 's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .

capsule : the best place to start if you 're a jackie chan newcomer .
roars along , never stops for breath , and frequently hilarious .
to talk about jackie chan as a " stuntman " is to miss a million things .
jackie is not only one of the most accomplished and fearsomely unafraid physical adepts on the screen today , but also a very funny guy .
he reminds me of the way arnold schwartzenegger * used * to make me laugh -- he 's funny just standing there , copping a look .
supercop has jackie making us laugh , scream , duck , root , and gasp for breath , often all in the same scene .
it 's actually the third in a loosely related series of movies , each with jackie playing kevin chan , a hong kong policeman who has a knack for getting neck-deep into trouble and then karate-kicking his way out of it .
( the others are also worth seeing . )
it 's a little slow to start , but once it gets moving , it 's a field day .
the movie has a fairly sophisticated plot for movies of this kind .
kevin is tapped for a dangerous dea assignment to be accomplished in mainland china , which requires him to collaborate with the attractive ( and ass-kicking ) chief fo chinese security ( played here by the ever-enjoyable michelle yeoh ) .
there 's a fun chemistry between the two of them , especially in an early scene where she tries to brief him and he keeps making wondering comments about how great she looks in that uniform .
kevin is assigned to help spring a known gangster from jail -- all undercover , of course -- and have him lead the two of them to a noted drug boss .
the drug boss , however , has problems of his own : his wife 's on trial for many of his own crimes , and she 's got the key to an account with all of his drug funds .
this means , of course , endless trouble -- not the least of which is that kevin bumps into his girlfriend while he 's out in the field , and she sees him with this other woman , and . . . but that 's one of the movie 's unique pleasures : the way it crosses from action to comedy effortlessly .
action . there is , of course , non-stop action in this movie -- everything from one-on-one kung fu to all-out gun battles to a sppedboat with eight engines ( ! )
outrunning the hong kong coast guard .
there is also a virtuoso climax , which features , among other things , jackie danging from a ladder tied to a helicopter , a wrong-way freeway chase ( which requires michelle to do an awesomely difficult handstand stunt ) , a fight on top of a moving train that also involves the 'copter as well as a motorcycle .
you get the idea .
this is to action movies what a burger with everything on it is to fast food : quick , enjoyable , filling .
watch it with friends .
when they stop making movies like this , the world will be a tad greyer .

why do people hate the spice girls ?
? what exactly have they done wrong , other than perhaps offend the fashion police ?
? so what if they are not " great " singers---they ai n't singing opera , folks , its pop music !
? who exactly is a " great " singer ?
judging by that opening paragraph it is obvious that i like the spice girls .
? they do what they do--sing some catchy tunes--and they do it pretty well .
? they are able to carry that into their first film , " spice world " .
? " spice world " certainly is n't a great filmgoing experience .
.
.
what it is what the spice girls are all about : fun , songs , and a lot of " girl power ! "
drawing from a number of different films ( like the beatles ' " hard day 's night " ) " spice world " chronicles the week heading up to the girls ' first concert at london 's albert hall .
? they get to tool around london in a big ol ' bus ( driven by meat loaf ! ) and generally have fun .
? in order to through a semblence of plot into the film , there is an evil tabloid publisher played by barry humphries , better known to americans , for about 15 minutes , as dame edna ( remember her ? )
? he wants to sabotage the girls ' concert so he can sell papers .
of course , the point in a movie like " spice world " is n't plot .
? the center of the film is the spice girls themselves : ginger ( the recently departed geri haliwell ) , posh ( victoria adams ) , sporty ( melanie chisolm ) , scary ( melanie brown ) , and baby ( emma bunton ) .
? each one has their own personality and , perhaps the best part of the film , look like they are having some honest-to-goodness fun , something that ca n't be said for a lot of people in films today .
along for the ride are richard e . grant as their manager , clifford , and various other characters making quick cameo appearances ( including teriffic british actors like richard briers and stephen fry ) .
? and , every once and a while , roger moore pops up as the chief to spout odd koans ( added bonus : he gets to , in the words of craig kilborn , dance , dance , dance . )
watching this film was fun , for the most part .
? there are a few slow segments , but overly , director bob spiers keeps things moving at a quick pace , with plenty of hummable spice girls songs in the background .
? his camerawork is fairly pedestrian , though the final concert number is done quite well with effective use of editing .
?
the look of the film promotes the high fun , with the design of the spicebus being quite original and eye-catching .
? add in wall-to-wall spice girls music and this film is lovable romp .
? if you do n't like the spice girls , you wo n't change your mind with this film .
? but , if you find them at least tolerable , get ready to sit back and chill because the spice girls are here to entertain you .
.
.
and do it quite well .

eric rohmer 's " pauline at the beach , " is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally .
the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) .
on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) .
while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) .
" pauline at the beach , " is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story .
instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it is n't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film .
this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969 's " my night at mauds , " and 1971 's " claire 's knee " ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote .
" pauline at the beach , " is a film worth seeing .

seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) .
one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise .
with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with ` dark city ' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie .
there 's an old role-playing computer game called ` d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who ca n't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there .
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .
the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we do n't have control over the protagonist .
we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it 's more than just the city , it 's the whole reality ) that is n't just that neo-gothic look ( a la ` batman , ' ` blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it 's almost a different genre completely .
later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what 's going on other than the fact something is not right .
the fact there 's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .
this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone .
the man does n't know who he is nor where he 's going and it 's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him .
in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it 's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we 've observed them for a while .
but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story .
eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police .
we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .
two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john 's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .
it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .
he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story .
but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in ` dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .
everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they do n't seem to be able to afford any gratuities .
however , that might also be what 's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .
by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it 's all a hoax .
everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction .
but , as the film 's tagline says , ` last night , one of us went off . '
for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as ` tuning ' ) .
the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .
at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then .
this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .
he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to ` the strangers ' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form .
the aliens mix and match the memories of the city 's population to see who will change and who will not .
in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world .
however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is .
the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly do n't help either ) .
for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film 's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film 's climax and ending .
and that 's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .
ironically , this is what made his first film ` the crow ' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world .
with ` dark city ' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .
still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .
there 's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does .
the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .
` dark city ' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .

-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass --
summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant !
to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis .
he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town .
we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them .
quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee .
the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely .
unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh .
the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story .
the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master .
so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours .
longer , more detailed review : [ beware of spoilers ]
the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell .
too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh .
you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you .
matinee is not like that .
i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis .
i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film .
but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters .
the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west .
i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today .
he is highly expressive both physically and vocally .
i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink .
the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film .
the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end .
i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic .
they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world .
unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time .
while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap .
several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light .
one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store .
if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here .
another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies .
one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space .
( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . )
while mant !
never got made , many films like it were , and mant !
serves mostly as dante 's homage to the b-films he loves .
so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story .
this is n't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way .
enjoy !

in roger michell 's romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it 's name to the film 's title .
one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey .
quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat .
the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna 's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress 's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such .
without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character .
following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives .
i do n't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we could n't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie 's beginning , but there it is .
if there were ever a clear case for " less is more , " this would be it .
the film is told nearly first person from william 's point of view , as he is in every scene .
by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily .
in fact , much of notting hill 's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis .
a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he 's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator .
or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image .
william assures her he would n't say a word , then adds , " well , i 'll probably tell myself now and then , but i 'd never believe it . "
great stuff .
the downside to spending so much time with william is that we do n't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible .
we 're constantly exposed to william 's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but do n't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him .
there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we 're not sure what she 's been thinking all the times in between .
this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant 's film hands down .
he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance .
julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress 's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character 's unpredictable behavior .
anna does n't get a lot of our compassion .
this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast .
most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william 's eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh .
hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william 's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister 's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst .
it 's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation .
roger michell 's use of visuals does n't sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type .
for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass .
whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying " eight months later , " michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william 's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him .
another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air .
we 're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird 's eye view of the ground below .
music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film 's scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect .
it 's kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today 's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video .
at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate .
notting hill 's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it .
for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that 's not so bad , now is it ?

there 's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably should n't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did .
" lucky numbers " is a perfect example of this because it 's such a blatant rip-off of " fargo " and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me .
i know i 'm in the minority here but let me explain .
the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter .
john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards .
russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema .
she 's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market .
crystal 's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager .
she does n't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it 's all she can do in this one-horse town .
much like " fargo , " this movie tells the story of a man who 's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick .
he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery .
along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , " dale the thug " ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process .
there 's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down .
i 'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you 're not expecting .
this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but does n't go as far as a classic black comedy should .
where as " fargo " was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , " lucky numbers " is just funny because you ca n't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously .
it 's all a big cartoon basically , but it 's funny and i can respect that .
travolta is great in his role and even though he 's not a really likable character , he 's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he 's a creep .
he 's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill .
crystal is just the opposite , she 's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself .
kudrow is perfect in this role since she 's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on " friends . "
here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe .
i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money .
like " jackie brown , " ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally .
the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus .
more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do .
the ending itself is great .
it 's surprising and funny and makes you feel good .
you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies ' worth of stories into two hours ' time and did n't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) .
i liked it , and i could see it again - is n't that what makes a movie good ?

do n't let the following quirks of this review , fool you into believing that this movie is anything short of an ultimate labour of love .
but one can see the humour of roberto benigni when you see that ?
life is beautiful , even though i 'm a short , ugly looking man with an obnoxious laugh .
life is beautiful even though i have n't amounted to much in life , except working out the finer intricacies of waitering .
i 'm a lucky sort of a guy , especially when a beautiful woman strips away my venner of superficiality to find a new age , sensitive guy with the biggest heart in the entire world underneath - life is beautiful !
i 'm a jew , but life can still be beautiful .
the nazis put me in a concentration camp , but life is still beautiful .
i love my son very much and that 's what matters , and that 's what makes life beautiful .
my ability to entertain somehow convinces my son that living in a concentration camp is somewhat beautiful ?
i get shot for my efforts and the woman i love , but hey that 's life and that 's still a beautiful thing - so by jove do n't give me any crap about it !
by far the movie with the biggest heart this decade and well deserves every nomination and award that it has achieved .
well done , there should be more film directors and actors like you roberto benigni .

roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton .
this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust .
but benigni 's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice .
the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni 's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore .
like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni 's guido has a childlike innocence .
he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government .
instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official .
in benigni 's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter .
guido wins dora .
they marry .
fast forward about five years .
guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family .
guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore .
but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities .
the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp .
here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated .
it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched .
for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler 's list .
true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor .
unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust .
his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child .
for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game .
giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points .
the winner takes home a tank .
therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks .
he can not make a sound nor allow the guards to see him .
guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates .
guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive .
throughout their imprisonment , guido 's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm 's way .
ultimately , the allies rescue the camp .
in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound .
the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game .
the price for his victory is most high .
benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness .
life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable .
it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust .
those who object to it are missing its point .
and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished .
committed to lifelong learning through effective communication

screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker .
screenplay by andrew kevin walker .
inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .
directed by tim burton .
starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien .
special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .
synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .
townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .
cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .
comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .
batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .
he 's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children 's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .
sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .
sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios ' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international 's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .
christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .
the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .
one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .
i mention these allusions for a reason .
seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film .
with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this .
not only does it have a sense of history , but burton 's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .
the film 's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .
johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving 's original story and is now an investigator .
depp is adequate in his role .
no more ; no less .
equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film .
she 's a good witch too .
how cute .
one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .
the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .
veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers .
while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing .
you have to pay attention .
andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .
he 's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven .
walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly does n't hurt his growing reputation .
as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic .
there 's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .
this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .
a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest 's eyes with her hand .
he was obviously upset by the movie 's intense violence .
if you 're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .

in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she 'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they 'll most enjoy .
some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before .
this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat 's true colors begin to shine through .
making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom 's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year .
what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom 's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what 's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences .
the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness .
chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion .
the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens .
many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne 's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business .
on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne 's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does .
also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends .
juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character 's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat 's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses .
lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs .
judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin .
carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously .
victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down .
a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : " five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . "
that 's not to say the men do n't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne .
the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film .
cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman 's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules .
chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter .
while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom 's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale .
and it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward .
the bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure .

warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career .
based on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system .
beatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who 's going through a nervous breakdown .
after hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what 's _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . )
instead of everyone hating him , the american public love him .
however , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin .
and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . )
it 's remarkable that this film was released at all .
much more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name .
the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true .
it 's great that beatty is n't afraid to let loose on a subject .
talking of beatty , he 's excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun .
and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed .
even in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor .
( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . )
the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . )
and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy ' has to be seen to be believed .
it 's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself .
second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps .
halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator .
also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she 's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun .
and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself .
the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par .
the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well .
the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever .
they 're not cringe inducing , at least .
the script makes many points about society in america today , and is n't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system .
best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining .
there 's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes .
bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws .
perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it 's irrelevant .
in fact , there 's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected .
bulworth , then , is well worth watching .

the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard 's materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute .
indeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products .
including this year 's upcoming a midsummer night 's dream , shakespeare 's material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen productions since 1990 .
but for a change of pace , mrs .
brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love .
marc norman and tom stoppard 's story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously .
( will shakespeare of the 1590 's would 've been married to anne hathaway , and he would 've had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . ) will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- " romeo and ethel , the pirate 's daughter " -- just does n't quite seem right .
with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , " romeo and juliet . "
the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect .
fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy .
the supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will 's worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman .
even ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance .
the story is well-crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the " let 's make a movie " -genre .
the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience 's lowest common denominator .
there 's something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material .
although certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998 's pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around .
certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year 's-open releases is just around the corner .

up until about a year ago , john travolta 's career consisted of those " look who 's talking " movies ( notice how they never called them look who 's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) .
but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again .
weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named " size is n't everything " ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) .
but now travolta 's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why .
four words : contract with the devil .
and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich 's " contract with america . "
no , satan is much more humane .
anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld .
how do i know ?
i own the document in question .
amazing what you can buy at those collector 's shops for a few hundred dollars , is n't it ?
get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer .
he goes to collect some of the mafia 's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game .
sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that 's beside the point .
palmer is determined to get hackman 's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito .
it does n't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from " who 's the boss ? "
to speechless .
it works in this case , unlike " who 's the boss ? "
although it 's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also .
complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman 's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta 's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting .
get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities .
this movie does n't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i 've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) .
get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence .
i 'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on .
are you getting this , shorty ?

the rich man 's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you should n't be enjoying yourself .
but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things .
not that it 's bad , it 's just that it 's been done before ; and better , in my opinion .
i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it 's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ?
that 's basically how i felt about this movie .
i mean , it 's not very good , but it 's not completely bad either .
the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) .
she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you
know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and does n't give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) .
thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) .
near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods .
once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i 'm still not quite sure what line of work he 's in ) .
making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars .
one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) .
they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal .
after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to " take care " of the problem .
managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband .
but then one night , cole shows up . . .
and here is where the fun begins .
from this point on , it 's going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects .
this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out .
and for the most part , they 're right ; the rich man 's wife has nary one original bone in it 's body .
but who cares ?
if you 're looking for good ol ' dumb suspense movie , you ca n't do much better than this .
and if you suspense buffs are n't already sold , it has a killer of an ending too .

capsule : suprisingly more of a comedy than a straight action flick , which is n't necessarily a bad thing .
not exactly oscar caliber , but one helluva bullet-riddled good time .
extended review : you know , i remember when hitmen were evil , murderous scum .
alas , the times are a-changin ' .
in a recent string of movies , hitmen are suddenly wise- cracking , fun-loving killers-with-hearts .
this brings us to hong kong director kirk wong 's first american feature , the big hit .
oddly enough , about the same time last year a similar film , grosse point blank , was released .
advertised as a quirky comedy with hints of action , it turned out to have a suprising dosage of it .
the big hit is quite the opposite .
it was hyped as " the new film from producer john woo " , so one would it expect lots of stylized killing and action .
however , there 's a sore lack of it , which is about the only thing wrong with the big hit .
the film starts out with mel smiley and his cohorts doing a job on a white slaver .
mel , played by mark wahlberg in a dopey , milquetoast role , is a killing machine ; he flips , spins , even breakdances whilst popping caps .
sadly , he does n't get a chance to do much of it .
except for the beginning set piece and the last 20 twenty minutes or so , the film is in comedy mode .
the action , at least what there is of it , is prime cut stuff .
wong , after numerous hong kong features , makes quite a nice u . s . debut .
however , his pacing is a bit off , with the action sequences only bookending the movie and not lasting long enough .
they start off electrifying and fresh , but just kinda stop .
normally , this would hamper a movie to the point of being unenjoyable .
luckily , we have ben ramsey 's screenplay , a bitingly funny piece of work .
the only problem is there might be too much humor , one joke makes you laugh so hard you miss the next few .
some of best gags include an oriental film maker down on his luck and one of mel 's hitmen pals that has just discovered onanism .
the only problem is how some of the minor characters are handled , some being there only for a laugh , which sometimes works , sometimes does n't .
overall , the big hit may have it 's flaws , but it makes up for them in a stylishly directed , gut-wrenchingly funny joyride .
definately one of the better ways to spend two hours .

waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : ` after all , we 're human . '
in the context of events to transpire , joe 's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film .
does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ?
through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility .
expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria .
in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar .
deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob 's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip .
we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar .
what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse .
what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless .
to the audience , the deputy 's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob 's delirium crescendos .
lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness .
the shot 's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions .
as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well .
the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality .
because the camera does not track the deputy 's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability .
as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob .
this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject .
while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob 's belly distorts the audience 's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large .
we see close shots of people 's faces , contorted by their rage .
with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching .
in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang 's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail .
in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind .
lang 's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior .
as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side .
lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts .
using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man 's volatility and ` impulse ' towards inconceivable cruelty .
reprising joe ' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .

much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of " lolita , " made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it 's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit .
when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well ,
you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution .
what 's even worse is that seeing this " lolita , " especially the first time and if you 're familiar with anything " lolita , " is admittingly very anticlimactic .
this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it 's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : " flashdance , " " fatal attraction , " and " indecent proposal " ) , at least besides " jacob 's ladder . "
i 've seen this " lolita " twice : the first time , i was n't so blown away .
it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting .
the second time , not really thinking about how i 've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i 'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally .
the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it 's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film .
the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it 's not trash for the perverted but because it 's about human obsession with things that are out of one 's reach .
its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies .
the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we ca n't live without .
these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating .
the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized .
the tone of the book is a comical one , but it 's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective .
humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed .
we get a sense that perhaps it 's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed .
he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita .
he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her .
the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace .
the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him .
the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who has n't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ?
this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who could n't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general .
in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits .
the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and
when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession .
the censors would n't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through .
looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we 've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it 's really impossible to compare them .
they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was .
and although it 's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it 's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse .
i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i wo n't say that here .
however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it .
it does n't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had .
some of that is in the casting of the two leads .
jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert .
he 's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does .
he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience .
and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he 's her prisoner for as long as he lives .
and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible .
she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character .
it 's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time .
when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her .
there are two other minor characters in the film , one who 's a road block in the beginning , and the other who 's a reappearing threat to the relationship .
the former is charlotte , lolita 's mother , played by melanie griffith .
in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish .
and she 's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning .
as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she 's about half of them .
it 's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first .
and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she 's nothing more .
the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price .
langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original .
quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk .
langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him .
as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise .
this version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening .
the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich .
the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita .
more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it .
by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he does n't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .

it 's a curious thing - i 've found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie , he 's much better and so is the movie .
even though , in the sixth sense he is the " name " , he does n't have the pivotal role .
that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts .
if osment was cute or precious , the director going for the maudlin , this would be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week , thankfully , osment is not only better than that , but in some instances , blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance .
we get to see his fears , vulnerabilities , strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i 've seen this year .
the whole cast matches him in quality , with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter .
one thing about this movie , its target .
this is n't a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest , this is more what i 'd call a supernatural drama , more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup .
one caveat : there 's a lovely twist in the movie , something like the usual suspects , where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen .
i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , before any hype or critical reviews were out , so i went in with no biases .
if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it , do n't let them .
let the director explain on his own pace and you 'll enjoy the movie vastly more .

this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated .
there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood 's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story .
this is the best we 've seen from disney since " beauty and the beast " ( 1996 ) .
this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story .
in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their " lives " .
one day , andy broke woody 's arm off , while playing with him .
woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards .
later andy 's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son 's room .
since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back .
although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale .
the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , " woody 's roundup . "
if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit .
so , after andy 's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it 's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend .
and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys .
there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) .
meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) .
they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan .
he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations .
the problem is , if woody escapes from al 's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage .
a real effort is made in the technical department .
the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the " cinematography " is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression .
lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie 's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on " jurassic park " and " star wars " .
the film ends with the " failed takes " , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv .
these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film .
but what in the end makes " toy story 2 " a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation .
it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself .
it is not difficult to predict that " toy story 2 " would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected .
unexpected because the first film was n't much more than a demonstration of special effects .
but mostly it was unexpected because disney has n't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs .
but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years .
this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation .
off course , this is not " antz " , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you 'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have .
whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say .
my choice would probably be " the iron giant " , but ( along side with " american pie " ) this is the comedy of the year .
i almost lost my hopes for disney , but " toy story 2 " proves that disney has n't lost their ability to entertain .

one of the sweetest tales to ever be made , it 's a wonderful life is n't perfect , but its good natured charm and beautiful performances light up the screen with glorious results .
probably the greatest " feel-good " film of all time , it 's a wonderful life aims for the heart , and strikes with a golden arrow .
on christmas eve , george bailey ( stewart ) is being prayed for by many in the small town of bedford falls .
you see , george is in trouble , and he has always helped others who needed it .
this one time , however , god answers his prayers , and sends down the lovable guardian angel clarence ( travers ) to try and save george .
clarence has got his own problems , however .
clarence is an angel without his wings , and each time the bell rings , the wings pass him by .
the bailey case is a way for him to earn those magical wings and become a true angel .
but before clarence can save george , he first has to go through a cliffs notes version of george bailey 's life .
we see george sacrificing his hearing to save his brother 's life , sacrificing his college education to save the family business , sacrificing his dream of living far away to support his brother , and even sacrificing his life to make sure his brother is happy working somewhere else .
when the bank his family owns is in trouble , george gives away his honeymoon money to make sure the bank is n't sold to the evil mr . potter ( barrymore ) , who wants nothing less than to get the baileys out of bedford falls .
one christmas , potter gets his chance .
uncle billy bailey ( mitchell ) loses $ 8 , 000 of the bank 's money .
without the money , the bank must close down .
george is stuck in a tremendous bind , and contemplates suicide .
clarence , the faithful servant , is there just to pick him up , and to show him what bedford would be like without george .
this is all a lead-in to the very famous last scene , where george finally sees what true happiness is about .
it 's a wonderful life does have its faults .
the movie is beginning to feel dated in the details , especially in the treatment of women and men .
the sex roles in the film are weirdly out of place in the 90 's , like something out of a revisionist look .
all the men drink too much and slap their wives too much during some portions of the film .
there are , however , endearing moments in all of this .
capra puts in just enough humor mocking the sex roles of the 50 's to make the movie remarkably enjoyable .
the story is hackneyed , and the ending feels , well , a little too sugarish .
there 's this uneasy feeling of sugar over everything , especially the sequences where george is either in trouble , or helping somebody .
it 's a little too nice for my liking , at times .
there is , however , enough humor , enough wit , and enough of jimmy stewart to get the movie through the middle part , which would be the most difficult .
but watching it 's a wonderful life is never boring or difficult : it 's always interesting , right until the finale , which , for all its sugar , makes delightful sense and is beautifully done .
capra does have his monumental cliches , but the actors relish them and overplay everything to perfection .
donna reed is perfect as the loving , obeidient wife , and lionel barrymore is gloriously grump as mr . potter .
everyone else is magnificent , including bert and ernie ( ward bond and frank faylen ) .
there is a general sense of goodness , as if everyone in the film knows that they are making a great film , and they relish that .
stewart , however , is the king of all of this .
he is sometimes awkward , especially when saying " merry christmas " to all objects , animate or inanimate .
but he is james stewart , and he 's lovably delightful throughout the film .
have i complained ?
i should n't have .
this is a really good movie .
no , this is a great movie .
better yet , this is a phenomenal movie .
there is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life .
this is one of those films .
it is a " feel-good " movie , something people complain a little too much about .
but capra 's reworking of " a christmas carol " is the greatest christmas movie of all time .
there , i 've said it .
i have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister .
they all loved it .
they loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending .
is it a little too sugar-coated ?
maybe .
no matter .
this is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate .
it is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope .
it is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all .
it is frank capra 's greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot .
for about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless .
the rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless .
i ca n't get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is .

gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit .
in fact , they 've been around in books and on film for many , many years .
without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated .
" the gift , " directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond .
it 's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions .
the film ultimately should n't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other .
annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown .
some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he 's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father .
for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone 's future .
her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that .
when annie 's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to .
but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about .
at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) .
soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home .
" the gift " may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999 's " for love of the game " ) lift the picture up several notches .
slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie 's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery .
at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999 's " the talented mr . ripley " ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her .
blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had .
we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress .
blanchett is n't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year .
in her first role following her oscar win for 1999 's " boys do n't cry , " hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie .
as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000 's " the watcher " ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all .
for the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given .
giovanni ribisi ( 2000 's " the boiler room " ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad .
in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000 's " wonder boys " ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn .
her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes .
finally , kim dickens ( 2000 's " hollow man " ) makes her usual strong impression as annie 's spicy best friend , linda .
the other notable aspect of " the gift " is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it 's almost suffocating .
thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread .
helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , " the gift " is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too .
it may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time .

* * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *
the previous two " alien " films have each had their own unique styles to them .
the ridley scott 's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film .
james cameron 's aliens was much more of an action film .
and i liked each film separately for which it was .
now alien 3 is out .
and it is it 's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were .
unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens .
this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off .
the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens .
the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg .
in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel .
this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .
everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley .
the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .
fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .
when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .
all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years .
ripley 's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .
as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner 's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet .
being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .
so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .
i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here .
the alien is loose and no one believes ripley 's outstanding story .
she finds comfort in the arms of the colony 's doctor .
yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .
it is not gratuitous , in fact , we do n't even see them kiss , but it is just as well .
a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .
there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .
in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .
it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !
i wo n't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .
sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .
her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .
the rest of the cast is also quite good .
notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .
alien 3 has a very distinct look .
this is due largely to its director , david fincher .
mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here .
his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no " alien " film has before .
for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .
the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .
elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the " alien " series been set in .
this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner 's aliens ) .
this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .
this is a great score .
the ending to alien 3 is quite good .
there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .
i will not ruin the ending for you .
go see the film .
i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .
alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .
and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in .

i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again .
and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you 're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) .
this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite .
contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they 're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 .
this one , however , is shockingly not bad .
in fact , it 's actually good .
not the original good , but what 's great about it is that it does n't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining .
because it 's cute and innocent fun .
because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with .
because the lead star is immensely appealing .
because the parents are also immensely appealing .
and ( i 'm repeating myself ) because it 's cute and innocent fun .
there 's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it 's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid .
i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third .
i can vividly remember when my taste in movies was n't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick were n't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc 's " wonderful world of disney , " where they 'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week .
i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like " lady and the tramp " and " pinnochio " ) .
and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children 's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i would n't dare missing .
i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv " parent trap ii " on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original " parent trap . "
it 's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version .
it 's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i 'd probably dismiss it .
i 'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i had n't seen the original at such a perfect age .
watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence .
and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better .
this new version did that for me , but it 's also charming in its own way .
it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that is n't corny or condescending , but just right .
the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way .
and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults .
the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa 's " the seven samurai " : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents .
one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin ' fashion designer .
she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing .
the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming .
they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged .
they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin .
there , they become friends , then learn about eachother .
once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they 've only heard of .
they learn about eachother 's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in " pulp fiction " ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best .
lindsay lohan does n't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original .
but she comes off just as appealing as she did once .
she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively .
she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones ' accents are n't exactly perfect .
she 's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films .
she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing .
dennis quaid , in fact , has n't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he 's mr . meg ryan .
ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just has n't ever been this likable period ) .
the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film .
instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film 's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films .
this all brings this new " parent trap " to a level of entertainment that has n't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time .
this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who 's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore .
like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : " it takes two " starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around .
and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew .
however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better .
certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original .
i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear .
and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom .
the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences .
as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances .

one year has passed since the last time we saw them , and but wayne campbell and garth algar are back but , they 've moved out of their parents homes , and now have their own pad in an abandoned warehouse .
wayne 's still hopelessly infatuated with his girlfriend , cassandra , and of course garth is still having his own , personal growing pains .
they guys are just finishing off one of their shows , and head off to an aerosmith concert where they run across cassandra and her new manager , a stereotypical industry slime not unlike the character rob lowe portrayed in the previous film .
again , the promoter is not only after the money that cassandra 's talent can bring in .
the storyline quickly degrades to a parallel of the original , " guy loses chick , guy realizes mistake , and guy gets chick back . "
fortunately , there is more to this movie than this somewhat sheer plot .
the wit and humor in this film are surprisingly intelligent and fresh with many inside jokes on the film and music industries as well as just a lot of hilarious scenes of wayne and garth showing their true color .
highlights of the movie include a spoof of jurassic park , garth 's seduction by a married woman , a surprise appearance by charleton heston , a 1960 's batman setup in the guy 's pad , and some pretty groovy chats with jim morrison and some " naked indian guy , " an unexpected lip-sync of ymca ( you could see that one coming a mile away ) and of course a hilarious parody of those badly-dubbed kung-fu movies we love to laugh at .
and if you 've ever wondered why there 's always boxes of watermelons , chickens , and people walking plate glass in the middle of streets , you 'll find out here .
this movie also explores wayne and garth a little more .
garth has somewhat of a " coming of age " and wayne gets to learn a little about himself ( with a little help from our old friend , jim morrison ) .
a few old jokes from the previous movie are explored here again , but this time with a few twists to keep them fresh , and luckily , few , if any of them are overused .
overall , the movie has plenty of continuity flaws ( especially in the fight scent between garth and cassandra 's dad ) , but these are easily overlooked as this is , after wayne 's world .
the plot is flimsy but manageable .
there are a few special effects , but they are fairly seamless , and fill nicely into the plot .
the acting is good , for this sort of movie , but there are some very bright spots .
in the big picture , this movie is just plain fun .
there is lots of intelligent humor that makes this film special .
during the whole one hour and 40 minutes , i did n't even think about looking at my watch a single time .
silly , but riotous at times , this is an excellent movie even better than the original .

in tim burton 's ` sleepy hollow ' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name .
he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe .
burton 's update on washington irving 's classic tale of ` the legend of sleepy hollow ' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror .
writer andrew kevin walker ( ` seven ' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine .
as ` sleepy hollow ' opens , we 're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton 's ` ed wood ' .
landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider .
after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate .
landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods .
crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) .
first and foremost , ` sleepy hollow ' is a fun horror film .
as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly .
the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors .
but why did i enjoy ` sleepy hollow ' as much as i did ?
although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . .
it was the light comic touch that burton applied .
the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp 's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities .
this is certainly not the only alteration that 's been made .
as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves .
the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it 's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved .
it 's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive .
still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton 's keen eye to capture our attention .
the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it 's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) .
the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many .
a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel 's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent .
walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton 's ` batman ' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles .
i suppose the strengths behind ` sleepy hollow ' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy .
all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course .
` sleepy hollow ' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children .
if you 've got a decent head on your shoulders , you 'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .

" say , any of you know how to madison ? "
--- brad " asshole " majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show .
the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend .
in the early 70 's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design .
the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england .
the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 .
the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . .
and immediately tanked at the box office .
whether it was because fox was n't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences did n't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop .
it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters .
a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened .
prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film .
this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time .
word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show 's life as the ultimate cult film was born .
for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton .
brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed .
they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home .
remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance .
the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) .
frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) .
as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter 's mad schemes .
little do any of them know that the doctor 's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth .
going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has .
if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i do n't think i would have known what to make of it either .
for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film .
by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on .
when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity .
it goes without saying that the " time warp " is the most popular song in the film .
even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song .
what those who have n't seen the movie do n't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment .
my personal favorite is " over at the frankenstein place " , but " dammit janet " is also maddeningly catchy .
tim curry 's vocals on the rocking tune " sweet transvestite " need to be heard to be believed .
the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . .
frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( " rose tint my world " , " do n't dream it " , " wild and untamed thing " , and " i 'm going home " ) , all of which are immensely singable .
the film 's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though .
despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it had n't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show .
watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you do n't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) .
note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton .
the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own .
o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original .
25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world .
as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) .
if you are one of those people who ca n't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites .
in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it 'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all .
the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) .
the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called " superheroes " .
for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen .
originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) .
most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced .
the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) .
the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) .
fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments .
the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is .
the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show .
most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter .
the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote .
when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world .
once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off .
the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player .
there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you do n't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you do n't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff 's story lab .
links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc .
the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras .
former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the " behind the music : rocky horror " special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung " hot patootie " .
the " behind the music " segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien 's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot .
there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews .
as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here .
one of which is just the " superheroes " number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called " once in a while " .
a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick 's pants ) .
for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here .
rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is " a different sort of jaws " ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for " toucha toucha touch me " and " sweet transvestite " ) .
fox 's special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( " you 're lucky . . .
i 'm lucky . . .
he 's lucky . . .
we 're all lucky ! " ) .
it 's not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format .
as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want .
i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition .

the happy bastard 's quick movie review
me tarzan . . . you
happy viewer .
for a minute there , i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney 's latest , another adaptation of a legend from the past .
( remember the pathetic pocahontas ?
yikes ! )
but guess what- disney , a company that 's been on a roll lately with animated films , strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you .
the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who 's lost her young adopts him into her group .
as he matures into a much older man , tarzan still wonders just why he 's so much different from the clan , and then arrives a hunter , a professor , and the professor 's lovely daughter , jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons .
from there , tarzan faces tough choices- should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england ?
the voicework here is pretty top-level .
tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man ; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already-beautiful jane ; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice ; rosie o ' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan 's best ape friend terk ; and wayne " newman " knight has his moments as a panicky elephant .
the movie is superb throughout , mixing a great script with incredible computer-assisted visuals .
when tarzan tree-surfs ( a twist that was added on top of the same ol ' vine swinging- and a great one , i might add ) , the camera twists and turns , allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly .
i could n't believe my eyes- disney has come a long way since starting in a ballroom for beauty and the beast .
and the music 's not half bad , either .
fortunately , there 's no ridiculous singing characters here , just a great set of songs by phil collins that perfectly fit the mood .
there 's some great action sequences here as well , including a wonderfully done chase between tarzan , jane , and the aforementioned babboons .
but , of course , it 's not all action- there 's a message here as well that has to do with family .
this is easily one of disney 's best animated films of the decade and it 's one i ca n't wait to put in my home library . . . that
is , if my vcr still works in the year 2000 .

a standoff .
a man holds a woman , a diplomat 's daughter , hostage in his embrace , a gun pressed to her head .
a cop , impaired by drink due to his wife 's philandering , trains his gun on the man 's nether regions , threatening to shoot .
another cop holds his gun to his partner 's temple , forcing him to disarm .
the scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridge--upping the ante , signaling tacitly , going for game .
the second cop retrieves the first cop 's weapon , the suspect lowers his , and the woman caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety .
it is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move , grabbing for the assailant 's gun .
the room turns upside down , a shot rings out , a cop is down .
shot in the back and paralyzed for life .
the young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he did n't commit .
storytelling has always been one of pedro almod ? var 's greatest gifts and in " live flesh " he gives us a twisting , turning , compelling tale peppered with well-written , colorful characters .
characters who find themselves , more often than not , in carefully-constructed scenes like these .
characters played by actors we might not know , but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless .
take the ruggedly handsome victor plaza ( liberto rabal ) , for instance .
before he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod ? var favorite , antonio banderas .
when we first meet elena ( francesca neri ) , the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown , she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair , but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis .
elena 's husband david ( javier bardem ) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmer 's bemused expression throughout .
playing the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos ? sancho and angela molina--no lookalikes spring to mind , but they round out the excellent cast .
it 's a credit to almod ? var 's craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity .
" live flesh " begins and ends with a live birth and the film 's contradictions come almost as often as the contractions .
between the two childbearings , coincidence , irony , and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film .
although based on a ruth rendell story , " live flesh " is brimming with the acclaimed spanish director 's high-heeled flourishes .
women are at times alluring and repulsive , their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama , an eye bruised by an abusive husband here , a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there .
while in prison , victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible , quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as " guardians of a sick flock . "
victor 's pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo .
" dear son , i got cancer " his mother writes to him in jail .
she dies before he is released and it 's at the cemetery that victor is reacquainted with elena--redemption , ultimately , substituting for revenge .

confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind .
i do n't know why , really .
have n't wanted to check it out on video , have n't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen .
so right up front , i 'll admit that i do n't know what the heck i 'm talking about , but here goes . . .
is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990 's ?
maybe that 's going a little bit too far .
as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they 're no clark gable and vivien leigh .
but . . .
the parallels are there .
gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor .
titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors .
gwtw places america 's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic 's most legendary tragedy .
they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . .
ok , maybe that 's not enough parallels .
so titanic 's not in gwtw 's league .
no matter .
titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills .
much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again .
the money was obviously well-spent .
the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great .
i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks .
but writer/director/producer james cameron 's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic was n't just costuming and set design and special effects .
cameron 's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in .
he succeeds masterfully .
cameron does two things that work incredibly well .
first , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that 's just " titanic " , not " the titanic " , mind you ) .
the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) .
television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 .
stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew .
secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) .
the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people .
cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board .
the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there 's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what 's he been in .
( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . )
the love story itself is rather conventional .
i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism .
the performances are the key here .
zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt .
he 's smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he 's a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible .
at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not " can i save this little girl ? " ,
but " can she help me get on a lifeboat ? "
dicaprio is a revelation .
i had n't seen him before in anything , and did n't know what the heck to expect , really .
( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . )
dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it 's hard not to like him .
from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters .
winslet 's character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance .
at first , she 's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous .
we know from the narration that she 's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there is n't any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio .
winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg .
it 's at that moment where winslet 's character really comes alive .
faced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job .
as rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal 's fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror .
of course , the most interesting character is the ship itself .
cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain 's table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead .
cameron 's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well .

because the press screening of " planet of the apes " was one day past last issue 's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece .
the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg 's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked .
to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ?
this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls .
tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories .
for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated " mars attacks ! "
( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage " mars attacks ! "
trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up .
burton 's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great .
the apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold .
like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later .
as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character .
from his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes .
so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders .
as for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back .
he does n't want to lead humanity and he is n't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) .
as a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly .
the surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly is n't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original .
for the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay .
the 1968 " apes " boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending .
but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball .
the 2001 " planet of the apes " offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending .
it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that 's nothing to complain about .

i can hear the question already .
what on earth do these two movies have in common ?
to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors .
as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers .
but oh , how differently the packages affect their films .
while " everyone 's " production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion 's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones ' script is .
i left " everyone says i love you " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face .
i left " the portrait of a lady " not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less .
" everyone " features nothing allen has n't done before storywise .
woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again .
similar situations happen to his family and friends .
some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his " early , funny " films .
the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of " take the money and run , " his directorial debut .
however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits .
in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what 's most important .
yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story .
but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling .
and what better way to express feeling than through music ?
love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart .
some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there .
it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him .
their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) .
but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience .
granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders .
jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in " portrait of a lady , " too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one .
campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind .
unfortunately , what did n't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting .
i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people .
even worse , i do n't find myself feeling bad that i 've forgotten .
the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material .
it was the script that could n't convince me to care about anyone .
the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them .
i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives .
jones ' script never simply gave me that opportunity .
in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes .
unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film .
in the end , the movie 's one strength ended up hurting it .
so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them .
why ?
with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only " everyone says i love you " was able to make my heart sing .

` strange days ' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles .
as the locals gear up for the new millenium , lenny nero ( ralph fiennes ) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips .
he pines for his ex-girlfriend , faith ( juliette lewis ) , not noticing that another friend , mace ( angela bassett ) really cares for him .
this film features good performances , impressive film-making technique and breath-taking crowd scenes .
director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it .
but as a whole , this is an unsatisfying movie .
the problem is that the writers , james cameron and jay cocks , were too ambitious , aiming for a film with social relevance , thrills , and drama .
not that ambitious film-making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals , it fails badly and obviously .
the film just ends up preachy , unexciting and uninvolving .

larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company .
the people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt 's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler .
based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it 's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt 's life .
woody harrelson gives an excellent performance .
he conveys flynt 's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus .
by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt .
this is some feat given flynt 's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court .
however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he 's rich , he 's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means .
larry flynt 's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love .
larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love ) .
both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs .
flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin .
althea had joined him in taking the drugs .
following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them .
as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick .
courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea 's situation , as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect .
it 's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away .
edward norton plays flynt 's lawyer , alan isaacman .
again , this is a solid performance .
the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt 's courtroom antics .
flynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it .
isaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways ) his points to the court .
milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs . larry flynt .
it is not really an exciting or thrilling film , but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story .
due to larry 's character it is also , at times , a very funny film .
however , it is much more than that .
it is about the fight for freedom of speech , anti-censorship , and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy .
an excellent look at flynt , his life , and his story .
keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey .

trees lounge is the directoral debut from one of my favorite actors , steve buscemi .
he gave memorable performences in in the soup , fargo , and reservoir dogs .
now he tries his hand at writing , directing and acting all in the same flick .
the movie starts out awfully slow with tommy ( buscemi ) hanging around a local bar the " trees lounge " and him pestering his brother .
it 's obvious he a loser .
but as he says " it 's better i 'm a loser and know i am , then being a loser and not thinking i am . "
well put .
the story starts to take off when his uncle dies , and tommy , not having a job , decides to drive an ice cream truck .
well , the movie starts to pick up with him finding a love interest in a 17 year old girl named debbie ( chloe sevigny ) and . . .
i liked this movie alot even though it did not reach my expectation .
after you 've seen him in fargo and reservoir dogs , you know he is capable of a better performence .
i think his brother , michael , did an excellent job for his debut performence .
mr . buscemi is off to a good career as a director !

every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections .
such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life .
despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film .
you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick .
will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it .
he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer .
he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk .
after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor .
after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems .
in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love .
the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film .
even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character .
alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it .
the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character .
is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ?
of course .
is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ?
usually , yes .
but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ?
not very likely .
come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school
girls .
will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition .
the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary .
all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways .
damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary .
which leads me to the really good part of the review .
the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting .
i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom .
from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent .
robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line .
the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting .
the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen .
when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about .
watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about .
gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score .
i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? .
despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year .

there 's a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election .
based on the book written by " anonymous " ( actually former " newsweek " writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton .
but he does n't actually play stanton .
he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) .
the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton .
he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss ' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers .
richard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president 's advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign 's eccentric " tougher than dirt " incriminator .
together they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race .
in its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue .
but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it 's characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent .
seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look .
and the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden .
at occasions , you ca n't help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste .
there are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry 's story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film .
having said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch .
but frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ?
most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we can not help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film .
but as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public 's opinion .
although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is .
thankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it 's scary .

i rented " brokedown palace " last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws .
for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety .
that is no easy task .
superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably " return to paradise " and " midnight express . "
as a result nearly every review of " brokedown palace " i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons .
the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film .
for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was " midnight express " ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of " return to paradise . "
in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad 's acclaimed novel , " lord jim . "
problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world " justice " system .
the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) .
they 're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents .
once there , they find a $ 6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside .
they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl 's scam .
he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene .
by now alarm bells are going off among viewers .
the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories do n't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice .
long before it happens , we 're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin .
just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch .
left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice .
for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl 's fleabag hotel .
as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer " yankee hank " ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife .
a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film 's tag lines , " who do you trust ? , " and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman 's oeuvre will find few surprises .
much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion .
lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments .
is he part of a wider conspiracy ?
with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them .
the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls ' interaction , hank 's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape .
if " brokedown palace " has a major flaw , it is its creators ' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story 's main avenue .
and , if that were all there was to " brokedown palace , " it would n't be a very good movie .
but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded .
for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations .
ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing .
young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure .
presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) .
clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend .
she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) .
whereas darlene 's life is " on-track , " aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and " fulfillment , " alice 's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning .
one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo .
tellingly , alice is present but not included .
just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice 's face does n't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while " dar " remains seated in the shade .
" brokedown palace " begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank .
however unintentional , it 's all alice 's fault .
she 's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick .
( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film 's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . )
dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence .
never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate .
dar is innocent .
it does n't matter .
alice is the subject of this movie .
she and her journey toward personal freedom .
along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals .
in the end , that culture , like its representatives , " yankee " hank and dar 's father ( a " man who knows how to grease the wheels " ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl 's tragedy .
thailand 's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison .
it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .
i believe the filmmaker 's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .
the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .
the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born .
their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit .
the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and " hard manual labor " consisted of picking grass !
the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic .
as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film 's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality .
'freedom ' has many faces and " brokedown palace " explores many of them .
in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit .
some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .
but freedom seldom comes without a price .
which is why the movie 's other tag lines are : " what is your dream ? "
and " how far would you go ? "
i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film 's end is alice .
she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility .
i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .
kate beckinsale 's character might more properly be likened to the " released " temple bird referred to twice during the film , " trained to fly back to its cage . "
as the thai magistrate observed in the film 's climactic scene , the issue was always one of " character ; " and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that " freedom " is achieved within oneself .
if one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ?
increasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of 'kung fu woman'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures .
here , at last , is the story of a modern heroine .
in reading the many user 's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors .
think about that .
when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ?
do yourself a favor : rent " brokedown palace " and watch it with a open mind .
there 's more there than meets the eye .

i have to admit that i disliked this film initially .
it certianly is n't for every taste , and it 's sheer torture to sit through if you 're in a restless mood .
that said , if you are in the right mood , it 's absolutely incredible .
this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year .
perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film 's unconventionality .
i 'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i 've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully .
on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i did n't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) .
the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of .
it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom .
and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) .
the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs .
the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes .
the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to " saving private ryan " in my opinion ) .
they 're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography .
the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen .
the only problems come during the first and third acts .
malick takes a little too long to get the film started .
although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers ' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in .
the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this .
the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it 's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times .
that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible .
the performances are phenominal all around .
the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars .
nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation .
his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him .
caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there 's any deeper meaning to the hell that he 's going through .
he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be .
although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company 's pessimistic seargent .
as to how it stacks up to " saving private ryan " - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , " ryan " was my first .
it 's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i wo n't , beyond saying that spielberg 's film had more of an impact on me .
however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would " the thin red line " above " ryan ) .
i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made .
all in all , " the thin red line " is filmmaking of an incredibly high order .
it 's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right .
it 's a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking do n't come along very often .

if you 've ever perused my college comedy diary " another year in the life of a nerd " ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i did n't get along with my first-semester roommate too well .
in fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him .
so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room .
then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk .
scratch that idea .
but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal .
of course , in my case it would be a silent picture .
even without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? ) .
i 'm glad i did .
peter falk 's performance was actually what made the movie .
and this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries .
falk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you " columbo " fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off .
falk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid 's parents die .
the movie begins with the mom 's death and the son moving in with his grandparents .
after a couple stops along the son 's journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave .
the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( " communists ! " ) .
the movie spans nine more years of rocky 's relationship with his grandson , and the trials posed when the grandson meets and falls in love with--gasp--a woman , and starts spending all his time with her .
so , in his grandson 's absence , rocky turns his pursuits to professional boxing , achieveing the world heavyweight title in a climactic fight with apollo creed . . .
or am i confusing movie plots again ?
roommates has an almost epic feel to it , covering several generations of a family with one fiesty immigrant who refuses to die .
death , though , knocks at the door of almost every other major character in the the movie .
roommates has about as many casualties as the first halloween .
the number ca n't be counted on one hand , unless of course you 're the victim of some hideous genetic mutation .
and you can probably guess who says farewell to planet earth at the end of the movie ( no , not duran duran ) .
i wo n't come out and say it .
instead , i 'll just sit here and hum " eye of the tiger " until each and every one of you figures it out .
roommates plays on all the major emotions .
it knows when to make you laugh and when to make you cry .
movies that can perfectly mix comedy and drama are always hits with the audience , even though this one bombed at the theaters .
my point ?
there are no absolutes .
or , another possible point , peter falk just is n't such a great box office draw .
either way , this is still a good movie and you should give it a chance like i did , whether you hate your roommate or not .

a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn ' .
followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer .
then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see .
well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here .
'here ' , of course , was still three months away .
i 'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow .
i 'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list .
that , let me tell you , has changed completely .
i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet .
the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick .
seriously .
i 've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry ,
make that 'roles ' in the movie .
even travolta 's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage 's character portrayals .
my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler 's hideout .
half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son 's death from castor 's perspective - " does n't it just break your heart . " he mutters coldly .
now do n't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it 's not .
that 's what really makes this movie unique .
it 's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all .
suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that 's
the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and
never hit .
several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind ' and watch it over again .
the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant .
whilst cage 's and travolta 's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing .
joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer 's long suffering wife .
i like the fact that her character did n't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it
would have wrecked her potrayal .
gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy 's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy 's mistreated girlfriends .
other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a
sex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent .
dominique swain , who plays archer 's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen 's or gershon 's .
faults ? well . . . there were some i have to say .
first , the movie 's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it 's own good .
after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you ca n't help but think - " geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? " .
there were certain bits that were n't handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice .
overall , this movie was not perfect .
but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect .
many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i
certainly hope so .

big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america .
o . j .
simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers .
all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms .
and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood .
whether it be john grisham 's thrilling novels or television 's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks .
so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat .
however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one .
john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it .
no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever .
but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting .
a civil action is not john 's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 .
travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations .
his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid .
if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average .
luckily , he has a strong supporting cast .
william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood .
he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor .
in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta 's paranoid and greedy accountant .
he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film .
he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant .
but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action .
robert duvall is also an underrated actor .
he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey .
duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant .
duvall is magical in this role .
he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way .
in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes .
unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) .
however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed .
this is not the case in a civil action .
they have comedy coming from all sides .
whether it be duvall 's inane questions or macy 's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace .
granted , it 's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film .
the plot is terrific- somewhat .
the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom .
then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head .
they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it .
however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt .
i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film .
the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored .
it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific .
all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film .
his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta .
the film is smart , witty and thought provoking .
not only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players .
a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .

shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school .
why would you want more of it now that your english grade does n't count on it ?
if this is your attitude , then i 'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh 's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now .
if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark .
namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king 's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play .
his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother 's hands .
hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and
the game is afoot . . . .
the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes .
with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established .
interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers .
the hamlet castle 's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft .
costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . .
not quite the denmark of the 1600 's , the characters ' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel .
it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively .
in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character .
as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows .
from the anticipation of seeing his father 's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades .
every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh 's acting and directing as to shakespeare 's manuscript .
hamlet seems to be a who 's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself .
julie christie , as hamlet 's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players .
kate winslet as hamlet 's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character 's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness .
richard briers as ophelia 's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing .
nicholas farrell as hamlet 's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast .
hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible .
in some cases , this made for interesting scenes .
billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well .
crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene .
however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all .
as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba .
part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time .
his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor .
i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention .
unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions .
jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just ca n't do shakespeare .
as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet 's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him .
gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of " yes , my lord " and " no , my lord " in the role of reynaldo .
richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador .
i think he had two lines .
then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway .
when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was .
if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you .
hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one .
branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images .
this only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them .
you do n't have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly .
the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course .
in it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king 's english .
or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .

i do n't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it 's something i used to wonder about when i was younger .
i ca n't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i 'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought .
the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public .
since birth , he 's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign .
all the people in truman burbank 's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras .
people watch truman 's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions .
revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman 's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones .
the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else .
even if you have n't seen the truman show , you 've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes .
if anything i 've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news .
either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you 'll probably think it sucks .
it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial " eat me " scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) .
but weird things start happening .
a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father .
we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm .
the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island .
similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman 's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he 's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he 'd ever do is hurt him .
as truman 's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else .
there 's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman 's existence .
the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions .
and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on .
he 's come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura .
most fundamentally , it 's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person 's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors .
the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this .
sure , the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer 's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves .
and when news shows use hidden cameras , it 's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment .
but merge the two and you 've got the truman show .
right now , it 's implausible -- i mean , the fcc wo n't let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they 'd let you broadcast every detail of a man 's life to the entire world without his consent ?
one day , though , it could happen .
and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up .
you know they would .

when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time .
while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good .
i 'm happy to say that there 's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs .
in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours .
the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island .
ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who ca n't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w .
earl brown ) , who 's being harassed by one of the school jocks .
it seems warren 's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted 's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up .
mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom .
ted was just flattered that she even knew his name .
unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital .
fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he has n't seen since that fateful day .
with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love .
however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections .
there 's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin .
not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them .
with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you 'll not only enjoy , but also wo n't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler .
the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers ' last two films ) they almost all work .
i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on .
one minute you 'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you 'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary 's apartment .
one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller .
he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he 's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation .
ted 's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just do n't always work out .
it 's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top .
actually , i 've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties .
the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money .
in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler .
it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived " the ben stiller show " on the fox network in late '92/early '93 .
like " the critic " ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show 's cancellation .
cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times .
however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she 's got guys just falling over each other to be with her .
heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week .
my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon does n't change , and you know , it 's really true .
he and ralph macchio must hang out or something .
maybe they live in dick clark 's pool house .
anyway , here 's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary 's heart .
the supporting performances are also good .
chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy .
lin shae , who plays mary 's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film .
lee evans , as mary 's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist .
the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there are n't any noticeable times where the film drags .
the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes .
they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera .
it 's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film .
after that it got a little annoying , and it 's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow .
fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there 's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .

aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads .
the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again .
when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson .
waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang .
as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence .
randolph kret 's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film 's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance .
the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one ca n't help but be disgusted by the events presented within .
i 've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher 's film was trying to define a generation .
kret 's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one .
if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w .
griffith ( thematically speaking ) .
there is not a single likable character in the film .
the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) .
the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost .
even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads ' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects .
the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge .
what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society .
the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable .
damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors ca n't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful .
his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend 's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film .
david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) .
wilson 's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly .
sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage .
ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed .
note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism .
the message about hatred could n't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation .
there are no " winners " at the end of this film either .
no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began .
where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah 's band of twisted souls .
it is this bleak ending that carries the film 's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely .

note : ordinarily , moviereviews . org will not give away any critical plot points of a film that could be interpreted as " spoilers . "
however , being that music of the heart is based on a true story and that moviereviews . org
feels the film can not be properly credited without such revelations , plot giveaways will appear in the following review .
if this bothers you , please note the 3 star rating of the film and stop reading now .
" what does it take to play carnegie hall ?
practice . "
it takes two hours for music of the heart to " play carnegie hall , " both figuratively and literally .
like the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall .
roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean .
her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school .
she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors .
that is the pattern-like plot of this production .
ultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish .
the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful .
roberta 's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat .
also lacking depth is the film 's " bad guy , " a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around .
the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre .
they are highlighted by one child 's return to roberta 's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be ca n't be around anymore because " my mom said . . . " ) and a glowing concert .
not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point .
but they do n't .
instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent .
director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing .
one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic " but . . .
last night . . . "
and roberta 's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father 's absence .
the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie .
roberta 's mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype .
the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta 's students is gunned down and killed off screen .
one thing the film does lack is subtlety .
the fact that a little boy was playing " we shall overcome " on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference .
the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience .
( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . )
even with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film .
that is not an excuse for the movie 's poor beginning .
but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage .
in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history .
the performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies .
so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ?
he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience .
perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa 's favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale .

if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it 's their predictable endings .
the devil 's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does .
unfortunately for the devil 's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film .
nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) .
i do n't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan .
well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) .
the devil 's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session .
kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl .
he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) .
he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury .
he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife .
after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer .
he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god .
he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck .
his life seems to be on the rise .
and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline .
he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment .
mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted .
meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people .
he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane .
all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself .
after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin 's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends .
a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin 's real father .
is it all just a big nightmare ?
or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin 's life ?
the devil 's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we do n't expect .
is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ?
if so , the devil 's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early .
i went into the devil 's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got .
i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got .
but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i did n't like the ending ? ) .
the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you .
films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less .
we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way .
the devil 's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all .
if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again .
as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study .
the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) .
and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur .
it was at this point that i felt cheated .
taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film .
everything occurs from his perspective .
he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) .
but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game .
i do n't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself .
perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil 's advocate is the extreme amount of everything .
it earned its r rating for a reason .
there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity .
this film really is n't subtle about anything , showing us everything .
it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh .
however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those .
i do n't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it .
the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch .
the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann .
portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann 's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline .
this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her .
she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted .
something the devil 's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature .
the story actually has something to say about humanity .
in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) .
he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity .
then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature .
this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening .
what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true .
these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil 's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i 'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) .
when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched .
the cast of the devil 's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we do n't expect .
heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job .
probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves .
he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance .
i have never seen him more believable to date .
al pacino is of course the scene stealer .
his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) .
he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) .
jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller 's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon .
judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin 's past .
connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times .
one familiar face with a twist was " coach " star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance .
the devil 's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore .
at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly .
for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters .
the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score .
director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes .
i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time .
but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream .
personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .

_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction .
if you have n't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you have n't seen it -- well , i suspect you 're in a small minority !
first thing 's first ? is it all it 's hyped up to be ?
well , yes ? and no .
it 's a good film , and there 's a lot to like about it , but it 's not without its problems .
when i saw the first trailer for " titanic " , it was when i went to see " bean " last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ai n't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? !
i mean , what 's happened to hollywood 's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ?
gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ?
i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i was n't alone in that respect .
it 's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who 'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice !
i did n't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) ,
so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still did n't think i 'd enjoy it much .
did i ? yes and no .
mainly yes , i 'm happy to say .
the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i 'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron 's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the " human " aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting .
the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a ' course !
: - ) ) .
well , it 's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat .
does it work here ?
in script form it does n't add all that much to the story .
what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film .
her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her .
also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving .
it 's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack 's " rescuing " rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .
in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance .
it 's engaging , touching and very enjoyable .
there 's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it 's not going to be a happy ending .
which leads us to the second half of the film .
we all knew it was coming .
i 'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he 's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film .
i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die .
the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour .
and it is an hour .
my goodness , we do n't miss a second of that hour ?
gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today 's standards , i 'm sure there 's been far worse produced under the banner of " entertainment " in other films .
but i certainly was n't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be .
not that i 'd expect the word " understatement " to be part of cameron 's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as " terminator 2 " and " aliens " ) .
is it overdone ?
i thought so .
understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy .
no , no one expected a happy ending , but i did n't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film 's second half .
still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears !
you really could n't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose 's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive .
perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface .
the bit where rose lets go of jack 's hand , while promising she 'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it .
i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half .
so , we 've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive .
have n't mentioned the script .
plot-wise it 's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i 've a feeling that 's to the actors credit if anything .
as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 .
it 's a period drama .
but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .
did they really use phrases like " goddamn it ! "
back in the turn of the century ?
i doubt it .
would someone talk like this : " do ya love the guy or what ? " .
i doubt it .
is such dialogue as " i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now " not just a bit ? clumsy ?
yes it is .
a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) .
stick with directing , dude .
but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast .
star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why did n't she win that oscar ? !
after all , they were throwing oscars at " titanic " left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee .
directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job .
like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well .
i have n't even mentioned james horner 's beautiful score .
utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it !
; - )
i 've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would !
just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ?
hell , do n't talk to me about oscars .
bloomin ' farce .
it was deserving in a number of departments , though .
last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ?
nope , i do n't think so .
it 's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i 've ever seen , but i do n't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites .
and as for the fact they 're reportedly making a " titanic 2 " ? well i guess that 's typical hollywood for you !

this remake of " la cage aux folles " features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son 's future in-laws .
the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical , gays possible .
williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star .
they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode .
williams is excellent as should be no surprise .
gene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles .
the real star is lane .
his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious .
perhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it .
luckily ( for me at least ) , it does n't last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception .
the question of stereotypes is a touchy one .
these guys personify the homophobic gay image .
you can almost hear the swishing .
if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world , you 'll be outraged .
but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals , you 'll love it .
your choice .

in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .
full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .
go see it !
so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on " hard copy " with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980 's .
" hard copy " 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman 's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .
smart replied that she thought kidman 's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .
( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . )
smart 's got a point .
it would n't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .
however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening ' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .
real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .
to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .
the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . '
of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon .
but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily .
kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .
i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .
her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .
kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .
she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .
at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .
" you know , " she knowingly exclaims , " gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . "
her husband beams at suzanne 's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .
this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks .
the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .
he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne 's sexual favors .
kidman 's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .
phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) .
his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ai n't going anywhere , ever .
phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him .
gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .
he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .
van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and does n't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .
van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it ' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .
the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i 've heard since heathers .
henry 's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .
henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .
danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .
either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .
all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks !
to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant .
written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .
rated r - for language and mature themes .
( respect the r , not for under 14 's ) rating ----- stars .
go see it .

contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan 's only novel .
it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) .
we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project .
her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains " pure research " in favor of science with " commercial applications .
she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r .
hadden ( john hurt ) .
then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal .
in the movie 's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega .
at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before .
further decoding , with hadden 's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine .
it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens ' home world .
of course , the big question becomes " who gets to ride it ? "
( right after " who 's gon na pay for this thing ? " ) .
to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith .
drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep " godless science " from talking to god , or something like that ) .
then hadden reappears with startling news .
he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest .
ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) .
when she returns home , no one believes her .
she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours .
her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who do n't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static .
.
.
eighteen hours worth of static ) .
there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first .
ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working .
neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that 's a tough standard to meet .
ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures .
her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally .
drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble .
hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board .
even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie 's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses .
the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine .
the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain .
the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion .
this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved .
the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith .
religious people are presented as shallow caricatures .
rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right .
another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) .
the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague .
i ca n't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian .
all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex .
the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith .
in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist " religious " doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send .
in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism .
what ellie should have said was , " you should n't believe me .
not without evidence , and i do n't have the evidence .
i know what happened but you should n't take my word alone . "
that is the voice of science speaking .
the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film .
his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position .
also , his profession of " faith " before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it .
the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles .
the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno are n't so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary .
the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause .
first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy .
also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it .
people watching this film in the future will say , " hey , this never took place during clinton 's term . "
this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief .
also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century .
better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all .
the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way .
if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ?
personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology .
i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task .

melvin van peebles ' " sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song " was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement .
it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident .
its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before .
in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , " sweet sweetback " was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter .
van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built " sweet sweetback " from the ground up almost entirely by himself .
because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself .
the movie ended up costing about $ 500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby .
van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film 's responsibilities himself .
he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role .
he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck .
for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases " rated x by an all-white jury , " which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film .
he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling .
the storyline in " sweet sweetback " is deceptively simple .
it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex .
one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they 're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder .
however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously .
acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death .
the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico .
although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles ' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked .
van peebles ' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored .
at the beginning of " sweet sweetback , " he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : " sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . "
van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration .
of course , with today 's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , " sweet sweetback " does n't seem all that revolutionary .
it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made .
at that time , " sweet sweetback " was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it .
distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles ' words , gave the black audience " a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . "
of course , once it caught on , it caught on big .
" sweet sweetback " is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates " sweetback " from other movies like " shaft " ( 1972 ) and " the mack " ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios .
" sweet sweetback " is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers .
however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , " sweet sweetback " is certainly not without its controversies .
when it was first released , an article was published in " ebony " magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it .
there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of .
others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives .
still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm .
nevertheless , a movie like " sweet sweetback " can not be made without conflicting points of view .
it is a revolutionary movie not because it 's about one man 's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before .
until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites .
the fact that " sweet sweetback " was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply " the black community " ) .
van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between " sweet sweetback " and all movies that had come before it .
when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman .
near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , " oh lord , let him die .
do n't let them kill him .
let him die on his own . "
it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she could n't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape .
and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : " watch out !
a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . "
beyond the political aspects , " sweet sweetback " is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be .
he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time .
he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him .
he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images .
the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment .
watching " sweet sweetback " more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite .
arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film .
but there is more to the film than its racial aspect .
the legacy of " sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song " is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .

when i was asked to see this movie with a friend , my initial reaction was ? not hugh grant ! '
i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead .
what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script .
this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral ' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between .
hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings ' .
he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck .
unfortunately , he is type cast in this role , but fortunately it works well for him in this movie .
if only he would dither a little less .
julia knows this role well .
the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love .
there are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness .
how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with .
the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels .
how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment .
how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice .

synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure .
everyone else around him has similar symptoms .
lester 's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain .
his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans .
and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living .
the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father .
when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it 's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family .
will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ?
opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it 's gone .
likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it .
sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world .
the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty .
american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie .
the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum .
the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is .
if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .

capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen .
one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse .
the idea is something about ghosts and the internet .
the film has an amazing apocalyptic style .
, + 2 ( -4 to + 4 )
perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? )
filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa .
his films all seem to have one style , bleak .
the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold .
little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver .
most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid .
his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with .
cure is probably his classic .
last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon .
that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story .
pulse is kurosawa back on form .
taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software .
two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment .
taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software .
meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain .
when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself .
if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall .
taguchi 's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus .
people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide .
but they are not entirely dead .
their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet .
people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost .
if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow .
the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist .
this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing " like a computer disk . "
instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses .
there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers .
leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death .
this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work .
it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish .
kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion .
frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact .
his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange .
junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa 's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone .
images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain .
scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might .
people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence .
seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary .
kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread .
of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch .
i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg 's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas ' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success .
little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film .
in january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary .
in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , do n't do much but call attention to themselves .
other than these , the film is exactly the same .
why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ?
simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born .
we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you have n't seen it .
the plot is basic but in the same way , complex .
it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight .
his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) .
he and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker 's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) .
skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force .
the film is obviously quite star-studded .
but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones ' voice would appear so many more times in the future ?
it just happened to work out for him .
the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker 's triumph is symbolized by the audience 's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever .

since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller " blood simple , " joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood .
their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances .
in " the big lebowski , " their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning " fargo , " the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude .
the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood 's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high .
the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties .
he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks .
he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in .
one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money .
the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here .
suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money .
by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski 's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in " fargo . "
" the big lebowski " plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers ' earlier efforts .
it shares their previous films ' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies .
" lebowski " has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made " raising arizona " such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of " barton fink " ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded " the hudsucker proxy . "
the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , " barton fink , " " the hudsucker proxy , " and " fargo . "
deakins always gives the coens ' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude 's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball 's point of view .
if " fargo " was the coen brothers ' most restrained effort in years , " the big lebowski " marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking .
it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end .
the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism .
with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out .
their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light .
the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it 's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet .

it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens .
however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill .
in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture .
the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps .
peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation .
every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in
other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life .
he 's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities .
he 's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but has n't the guts to even introduce himself .
everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck .
but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions .
he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing .
he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like .
peter 's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no ,
not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend 's sudden change in attitude .
but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . .
as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one .
although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life .
each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible .
yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal .
ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it .
his character is n't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity .
he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life .
anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film .
in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic .
the animated roots of office space show in the film 's lack of complexity .
most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk .
one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon .
however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny .
it 's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) .
the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .

steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and " oscar " -awarded critical triumphs like schindler 's list .
however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories .
one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle .
unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars .
although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow .
when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws .
together with other young directors of his " new hollywood " generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment .
ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of " blockubuster " philosophy .
but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie .
although very personal , spielberg 's screenplay was partly based on the book " ufo experience " by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 .
spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary .
that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot .
the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 .
such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience .
because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction .
in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project .
when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area .
there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions .
two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there .
spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects .
the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - " close encounters " - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale .
but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder .
throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end .
the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open .
one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism .
aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful .
it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks ' thing and byron haskin 's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind .
spielberg 's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public .
but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions .
there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama .
the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock 's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys .
despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles .
richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale .
melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for " oscar " as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary 's long-suffering wife ronnie .
apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg 's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score .
the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing .
too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said .
according to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos .
so , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life .
the result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts .
anyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema .

almost a full decade before steven spielberg 's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both " anti war " and " pro-soldier " , john irvin 's hamburger hill proved it could .
lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone 's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as " too militaristic " .
it 's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons " chose to show up " for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what " the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn " became to wwii movies .
hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch .
there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears .
and the climactic final assault on the " hill " in question is visually confusing .
gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered .
and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and " newbie " , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat .
the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as " seaman jones " in mctiernan 's red october .
if you 've seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg 's vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach .

it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system .
no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either .
the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority .
small wonder that hollywood 's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on .
there 's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government 's been long worried about the younger people getting " americanised " and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition .
the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex .
does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ?
larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net .
but even with such actions , americans remain undecided .
the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire .
what they have ignored is actually a great picture .
woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers .
and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly .
the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself .
edward norton plays their jerky lawyer .
the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who 've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids .
god 's damnation .
but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level .
friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences .
to go beyond good and evil .
this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally .
because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah .
but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases .
there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities .
this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society .

is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all-time ?
it 's quite possible .
his career spanned over 40 years , and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could .
yet , when he is talked about in the media , he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role : the nice guy .
and that 's really a shame .
" the naked spur " features jimmy stewart in a role completely different than what people would expect from him .
it 's a western , which stewart specialized in around this period , and it casts him as a desperate man out to collect a bounty on a man who used to be his friend .
before he finds that man , though , he runs into two men who agree to help him , thinking he is a sheriff .
when the criminal is eventually caught , the two men discover stewart 's secret , and decide they want a piece of the action too .
the rest of the film is a suspenseful journey in which each man suspects the other constantly .
also featured is the woman travelling with the criminal , well played by janet leigh .
we 're never too sure who 's side she 's really on until the end .
leigh is an actress probably best known for her role as the " shower lady " from " psycho " , and that 's unfair .
she gives a strong performance as a woman who is pulled between these two men .
stewart gives a performance unlike anything i 've ever seen from him .
he usually keeps cool no matter what occurs , but here , he gets downright hysterical at times .
i think perhaps he took this role to prove to the public that he was more than just a " nice guy " .
his performance borders on psychotic at times , but i loved watching every second of it .
it 's roles like this one that make me admire him as much as i do .
he was an actor unafraid to take chances , and even ruin his public image .

after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino .
it 's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language .
luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer .
the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another .
she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary .
but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope .
jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation .
soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $ 500 , 000 through to them under nicolet 's nose , with the help of ordell 's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) .
also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i wo n't say ) .
the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands .
it 's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and does n't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so .
there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters .
the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof .
the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie .
a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ?
you 've got to commend the acting .
jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting .
the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes .
tarantino 's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline .
also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear .
jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so do n't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath .
you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the ` n ' word as part of his regular vocabulary .
the acting is the glue that holds everything together .
grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970 's , is more than adequate for the title character .
in fact , she 's flat-out great .
another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so .
michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge .
speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell 's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied .
there 's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie .
which is a life-saver for mr . tarantino .
the story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake .
but oh well .
jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work .
let 's just hope that the director has n't gone soft on us .

ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ?
you remember , he was the title character in that 70 's sitcom , " welcome back kotter . "
always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife 's tuna casserole .
" so , " you ask , " where is he now ? "
mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker .
that 's right .
i 'm not sure if it 's his main source of income , but from what i 've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $ 20 , 000 at a time .
and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater .
you silly goose .
well , gabe kaplan is n't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler 's life .
but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection .
sorry about the segue , or lack thereof .
matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker .
he 's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug .
he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win .
in the beginning of the film , he 's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play .
mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia .
mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand .
months later , he 's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck .
when mike 's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash .
although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life .
to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters .
this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth .
rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former .
the card clubs mike and worm frequent are n't very glamorous at all .
there 's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots .
except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table .
the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it .
we 're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them .
matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker .
ed norton 's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they 're worth .
john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments .
he 's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro 's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich 's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself .
martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike 's law professors , abe petrovsky .
while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one 's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending .
perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just did n't seem to have much presence on screen .
she 's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i would n't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon 's reactions instead .
a good thing about rounders is that it does n't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it ca n't find time for humor .
the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales .
one game in a cigar club had me in stitches .
" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , " says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other .
i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys .
with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing .
you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again .
luckily , we 're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what 's going on .
the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do .
it 's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world .
as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades .
wait !
as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace .
hang on !
packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house .
okay , i guess that 's enough .
oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol ' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein 's mother .

most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts .
my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies .
i think he 's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years .
so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of .
unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen 's humor comes shining through .
those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen 's intelligent observations of life .
those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one .
in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they 'd never seen before .
toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present .
many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture .
antz , however , has upped the ante considerably .
disney 's a bug 's life is n't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal .
by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience 's thirst for computer-animated films .
but do n't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared .
in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios .
in 1997 , it was the volcano duel .
in my opinion , dante 's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality .
volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations .
in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films .
first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it 's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact .
but now , it 's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) .
who will prevail ?
time will tell , but i 'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear .
this may sound like i did n't like antz ; on the contrary , i 'd put it up there with toy story .
but due to it 's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which should n't appear in disney 's version .
some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film .
sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks ' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd .
the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended .
this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents .
antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen 's shtick and franz kafka 's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug .
z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker .
" when you 're the middle child in a family of five million . . . " he comments about his neglected childhood .
one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life .
in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown .
bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader .
after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there 's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony .
in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants .
but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her .
he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed .
the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony .
meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him .
so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites .
the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence .
however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence .
the second half of the film revolves around z 's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia .
there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants .
the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass .
looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i 'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) .
the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground .
visually , it 's an exciting rush of adrenaline .
but do n't be fooled . . .
little kids should n't see this , as they may just try and copy it .
after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again .
hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel .
as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date .
visually , it 's as stunning as what dreams may come .
the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters are n't limited by gravity .
they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible .
one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball .
the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball .
however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy 's shoe .
it 's truly a great example of film making at its finest .
with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants ' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices .
the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) .
at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . .
do they ? ) .
barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body .
young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) .
disney 's a bug 's life looks good , but i do n't know if they will be able to best dreamworks ' newest animated feature in terms of animation .
if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) .
vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story .
in fact , it far exceeds that one .
woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he 's done in the past few years .
without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing .
in fact , i 'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines .
sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress .
sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star .
after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is .
gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona .
christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns .
anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she 's effective nonetheless .
danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job .
dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd .
jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people wo n't recognize her voice either .
many people will recognize grant shaud 's voice as the foreman .
he played miles on the tv show murphy brown .
this is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it 's grosses .
of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $ 60 million budget went to , also .
directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) .
but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture .
tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals .
the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults .
kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor .
most of it will go over young children 's heads .
does that mean you should n't take kids to see it ?
not at all .
they will have a lot of fun watching this one .
what is great is the themes that are given to us .
part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community .
thankfully , it 's not subtle in either aspects .
antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action .
sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home .
the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death .
and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight .
but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it 's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters .
i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it 's still advisable to leave really young children at home .
have i confused you enough ?
if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you 'll enjoy it the most .

the ultimate match up between good and evil , " the untouchables " is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .
based on the 1959 television show of the same title , " the untouchables " may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .
however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .
the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone 's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .
from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .
right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .
this developed hatred is before the film 's hero , ness , is even introduced .
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .
the film only gets better from this point .
with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .
they walk in unison and they only look forward .
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .
holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .
one that comes to mind is " the matrix " when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .
wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930 's style , the similarities between these two are countless .
" the untouchables " has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .
the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone 's army .
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .
elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .
however , as the film develops so does ness .
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .
sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .
malone acts as a mentor to ness .
he teaches him " the chicago way " to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .
andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .
as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .
also very similar to " the matrix , " they are exciting and intense .
> from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .
the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .
its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .
the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .
although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .
some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .

pulp fiction , quentin tarantino 's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time .
in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it .
as if reservoir dogs was n't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way .
every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor .
to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) .
these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect .
travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role .
if these two characters were not enough , there 's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the " problem solver " himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) .
these are just the major characters .
smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men " behind " ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film .
the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other .
the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups .
the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead .
after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle .
utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants .
the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace .
after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase .
this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357
" hand cannon " , shooting at the two gangsters .
he somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention .
this is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue .
the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades .
butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune .
vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus ' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town .
vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage .
after their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent 's high-priced heroin , dubbed a " monster " by lance .
each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur .
eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules .
pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time .
along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you .
and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering .
surely , quentin tarantino 's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon .

warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it .
while i do n't blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) .
but , in a nutshell , it 's a good film .
star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim
never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace .
however , it ca n't be ignored .
endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult .
with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations .
thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better .
while the " first " star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) .
without blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it 's up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it .
the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat .
common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects .
still , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for .
hence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the " improvements " in the special editions ) .
there are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious " pod race " sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in " ben hur " ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids .
utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail .
no matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new .
the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans .
best described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show .
unfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) .
with star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times .
there are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) .
that , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it 's no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) .
still , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point .
the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you 'll blow in your life , which is something i would n't mind doing again .
while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ?
the film is pure fun from beginning to end .
and is n't that what really matters ?

i 'm not really sure what to think about " crash . "
on the surface , it 's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork .
i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out .
but then again , not every film 's supposed to leave you entertained .
" crash " is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue .
while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization .
not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we do n't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed .
but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience .
this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of " henry and june " or the just plain horniness of , say , " deep throat " ( not that i 've seen it ) .
if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole " auto eroticism " thing .
the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge .
the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of " the game " ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar .
suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt ' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 ) .
the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie .
the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they 're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another 's escapades .
while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge .
soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he 's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on .
james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive .
the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again .
when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident .
you would n't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it .
vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes .
in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean 's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) .
soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex .
while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who 's main fetish is living on the edge .
i 'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally do n't see a connection between car crashes and sex .
the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush .
his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we 're at first not sure if they 'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp .
then when it happens , we hold our breath .
the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion .
these people are merely taking it to another level .
the only problem with the film is that it 's a tad redundant .
a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half .
this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long .
the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side .
there 's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it 's a porn , and we 're not here to sympathize .
but still , they coulda cut it down a bit .
but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements .
the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling .
and there are several scenes are just amazing .
one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it .
a sequence involving one character 's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs .
and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she 's wounded .
the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) .
while james spader is pretty boring ( he 's usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing .
she speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she 's having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she 's enjoying it or not .
in one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her .
holly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) .
but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone .
he often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life .
he has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he 's taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he 's getting a freaky tatoo .
he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene .
kosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in " teenage mutant ninja turtles " ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he 's capable of bigger roles .
while i hardly enjoyed " crash , " it 's still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world .
these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which does n't exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out .
despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there 's also an r-rated version , but i would n't even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno .

this summer , one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham 's series , a time to kill , was made into a major motion picture .
on january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi .
based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars ' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband 's obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed .
so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven 's prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member .
ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history , from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960 's .
but all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like " what 's america got to do with anything ?
this is mississippi ! "
as beckwith , james woods , with his head larded with latex most of the time as an old man , teeters between portraying evil and its character .
meanwhile , goldberg turns in a very serious and weepy performance as the wife who would n't let her husband 's death rest until she got the conviction .
both deserve serious oscar-consideration .
this brings us to the dull performance of baldwin .
let 's face it , trying to match matthew mcconaughey 's wonderful acting in a time to kill is basically impossible .
and baldwin is living proof of this , as no emotions could be felt .
it seemed as if he actually had to struggle to shed a single tear .
either poor acting or poor directing , but something definitely went wrong .
another strange mishap was the fact that goldberg 's facial features did n't change , as she looked the same in the courtroom as she did holding her husband 's dead body 25-years earlier .
yet woods ' was plastered with enough make up to make him look like goldberg 's father .
at least the make-up was realistic .
with some emotional moments in the poorly written script , ghosts of mississippi lacked in heart , when its predecessor , a time to kill , brought tears to everyone 's eyes .
do n't get me wrong , the movie was n't all that bad , but if you 've seen grisham 's masterpiece , then do n't expect this one to be an excellent film .

note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .
be forewarned .
milos forman 's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia 's the people vs .
larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s .
the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky .
cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati .
the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter .
this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history .
what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost .
the people vs .
larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt 's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations .
considering the serious nature of the film 's theme - the importance of the united states ' first amendment - the people vs .
larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous .
much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt 's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity .
the film 's focus is on the flynt 's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs .
larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea .
larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side .
there 's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking .
ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea 's love for each other .
woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt .
harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film .
courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive .
it 's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it 's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on .
edward norton , as flynt 's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs .
larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film .
one can sense the frustration that norton 's character feels when harrelson 's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton 's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges .
milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic .
there 's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining .
two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs .
larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech .
consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion .
it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level .
for example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter 's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me .
then again , perhaps it was to him as well .
these two points do n't detract greatly from the film .
the people vs .
larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story .

first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series .
i have nothing against it particularly , i just do n't happen to watch it .
having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well .
for us non-fans , there 's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things .
the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c .
two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside .
the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien .
the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze .
we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail .
a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas .
on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , would n't you know it , he turns out to be right .
the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse .
five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head .
the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made .
their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to " the truth . "
the plot , and " the truth , " are uninspired .
i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me .
it did n't .
the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them .
but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden .
it 's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that " truth " too high .
if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring .
but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it .
the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest .
before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth .
the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either .
there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . )
make this fantastic film feel more real .
ward russell 's cinematography is very good .
the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film 's plot .
russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding .
when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed .
finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train .
i do n't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great .
the movie 's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip
to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound .
in one of the movie 's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees .
the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound .
there was no question as to who the movie 's stars would be .
even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination .
both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy .
there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship .
they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street .
there might be some romantic interest , but for now they 're more interested in their environs than they are in each other .
no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular .
but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along .

of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable .
think about it .
frankenstein movies have n't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting .
if you made a frankenstein movie today , you 'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there are n't any actors that could play a virus convincingly .
movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt .
there 's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something .
( and there 's that michael j . fox thing again . )
but you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about .
you can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker 's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) .
you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) .
were it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires .
any day now , i expect we 'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record .
or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade .
wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path .
in this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses .
snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers .
blade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse .
he is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets .
yet , he 's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent .
like any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action .
for some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver .
( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . )
unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles .
the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i did n't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i could n't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat 's performance .
blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it 's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance .
with a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment .
as it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .

" you 'll go ape over tarzan because it 's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! "
okay , there 's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie .
disney 's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship .
father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson .
it 's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack .
before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard .
against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own .
tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild .
much of tarzan 's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his " father , " which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts .
all he 's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults .
when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end .
look back on past disney animated features and you 'll see the trend .
growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends .
one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) .
both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold .
i 'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films .
just fill in the blanks !
can you see it ?
" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it .
we 've already had a fish and a crab , and we 've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have
we had an ape and an elephant yet ?
well , there we go ! "
of course , there 's got ta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through .
together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa .
she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory " you tarzan , me jane " scene .
thankfully , those are n't the exact words .
however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going " ohh ohh ee ee " one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction .
how does he tell his name to another ape ?
" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? "
well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable .
but hey , tarzan 's a young adult .
do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ?
is n't that illegal in most countries ?
oh , well .
i do n't think disney will be using my quote anymore .
tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical .
there 's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time .
we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material .
this is n't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it 's just different .
do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie .
with each new feature , disney animation gets even better .
not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan .
there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying .
the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this is n't just tarzan , it 's " extreme tarzan . "
however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its " chandelier scene , " which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking .
lasting but a few seconds at most , it 's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail .
as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters .
the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell .
going into the film , i did n't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately .
her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , " that 's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . "
distracting to say the least .
i 'll admit i 've never read the edgar rice burroughs story " tarzan of the apes , " so i could n't tell you how true this film stays to the book .
but unless you 're a purist , you should have few objections to this film .
with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us .
note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature .
this time , i 'll just say that i went to mcdonald 's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup .
'nuff said .

as the small boats rock slowly toward the shore at omaha beach normandy on d-day , the weary , seasick soldiers take a deep breath and open the large protective shield at the back of the boat .
they are unaware of exactly what is going to happen .
one man kisses the crucifix that hangs around his neck .
as the flap falls , the battle begins .
they are trapped like rats in a cage and proceed to be blown to pieces in the wake of enemy gunfire .
amid the chaos of this massacre , stands a shot that , at least for me , hangs in the air like the girl in the little red coat in schindler 's list .
a soldier , clearly missing an arm , wanders around the body-strewn beach like a lost puppy .
we are not invited to know what he is searching for until he finds it himself .
he bends over , picks up his arm and starts to carry it , probably not bothering to ask himself ; " what now ? "
saving private ryan is a masterfully composed film .
the direction is out of this world , surely the type of command that can win spielberg another directing oscar .
the cinematography , by janusz kaminsky , is also astounding .
but be forewarned , this is the most violent and graphic film i have ever seen .
the articles you read and the warnings you see are justified ; saving private ryan is visually as disturbing as a film can get .
the question is , " does the story and its realism justify the excessive use ? "
the answer from my point of view is " no " .
braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film .
ryan is ten times worse .
expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield .
many in the theater could not bear to watch .
and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year .
but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) .
saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film 's primary mission .
captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield .
the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan does n't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice .
miller 's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they do n't yet know him .
they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who does n't have any more or less right to live than any of them .
this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end .
the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it 's own .
spielberg , though not a student of the " quick cut " school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it .
bay should pay close attention , take copious notes .
if you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan .
in the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the " importance " of the film .
schindler 's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust .
it opened eyes , sparked debate and study .
though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they do n't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler 's list .
overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , " war is hell . "
but braveheart-dosage would have fit this movie much more appropriately , and would have made the difference between me getting up the nerve to see it again some day and realizing that this is something i doubt i could endure again .
masterful work marred only by excessive gore .

wong kar-wei 's " fallen angels " is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i 've seen in a long while .
unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for .
ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of " fallen angels " , this is not so .
every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at .
wong does really interesting things with the camera , but he does n't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal " knock off " ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe .
ugh . )
the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives .
i ca n't say much more than that as i did n't really know what was going on most of the time .
in fact , it was n't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character .
the constantly moving camera does n't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character .
we 're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters .
" fallen angels " is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level .
in fact , i 'd go so far as to say that " fallen angels " is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i 've ever seen .
sure , there 's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating .
but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images .
there were far too many instances during " fallen angels " in which i asked myself , " now who are these people again ?
is this that first couple or the second couple ? "
it was impossible to keep track .
perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with " name cards " , as in scorsese 's " mean streets " .
that 's really besides the point , though .
wong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that 's he 's a movie-maker to watch .
let 's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies .

" dangerous beauty " is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 .
it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness .
dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff .
the director , marshall herskovitz , does n't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation .
the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe .
at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce .
the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived .
however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment .
the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) .
unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders could n't get in .
veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider .
after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he can not marry her .
however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco 's world , albeit not as his wife .
she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite .
a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied .
at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants .
veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself .
once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well .
she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco .
their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco 's advances .
in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love .
" love the love , not the man , " as her mother told her .
" dangerous beauty , " which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice .
it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica 's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france 's military assistance in venice 's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing .
much of the film 's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role .
known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson 's ire in " braveheart " ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady .
she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes .
the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in " dark city " have assured him a solid place in hollywood .
he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas .
oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy .
platt is a good actor , but he 's just too hard to hate .
jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco 's uncle .
" dangerous beauty " is marshall herskovitz 's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film " jack the bear . "
partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( " thirtysomething , " " my so-called life " ) and in the movies ( " legends of the fall " ) .
his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions .
he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids .
" dangerous beauty " contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative .
herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller " kalifornia " ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara 's dark sci-fi film " body snatchers " ( 1994 ) .
bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery .
however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( " brazil , " " the princess bride " ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( " the age of innocence " ) .
the only problem with " dangerous beauty " is that it does n't stick with you .
it 's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it 's easy to shrug off once you 've left the theater .
the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it 's simply too melodramatic and conventional .
herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter .

for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america 's finest actresses .
in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison 's largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well .
the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina .
through voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly did n't survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident .
that 's just the beginning of her troubles .
bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come .
anney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident .
anney 's brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill .
glen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( " when are you gon na make your daddy proud ?
i 'll tell you when - never ! "
he 's told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper .
when anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour .
things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment .
while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today 's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other .
the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance .
her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone 's performance stands up well .
leigh 's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she 's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character 's moods in and out of explosive rage .
one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away .
of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker 's performance .
there 's a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance .
still , it can not be denied that anne meredith 's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power .
huston 's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone .
her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective .
huston 's talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile .
the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience .
perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing .

the question is n't why has grease been reissued .
the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie 's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount 's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .
no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ?
the answer is not an easy one .
grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era .
the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited .
travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening .
but grease did n't break any new cinematic ground .
it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider .
what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history .
ok , let 's not be a spoilsport .
grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi 's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers .
it 's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it 's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career .
he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly .
cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur .
between grease and 1996 's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand .
two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .
today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .
today 's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .
secondly , a lack of talent .
performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .
most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .
a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world .
he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles .
so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose .
if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals .
perhaps not original musicals such as singin ' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years .
at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber 's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna .
so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals .
let grease be the word that sparks this revival .

there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason .
" good will hunting " is about one of those people .
the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let 's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius .
he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino .
and he works at mit . . . as the janitor .
one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( " breaking the waves " 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete .
the next day , it 's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it .
so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove .
and , duh , it 's done again .
of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will .
before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy .
after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , " afternoon delight " ) .
finally , lambeau 's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up .
turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not .
it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge .
and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction .
is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ?
should this guy be forced to do something he does n't want to do ?
this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should .
i 'm not saying " good will hunting " is a bad film at all .
it 's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it .
the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together .
we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will 's love interest , skylar .
there are tons of individual moments that i adored .
i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them .
i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends .
there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch .
and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable .
like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean 's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he does n't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter .
however , the main flaw of the film is there 's too much of everything , and not enough of it either .
the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they 're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten .
take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face .
we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times .
but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do .
also , will 's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action .
we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one .
their relationship never goes beyond " just best friends , " and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human .
maybe it was just me .
and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten .
and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten .
we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it 's there for plot details that anything else .
minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character .
the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness .
sure , it feels overstuffed , but it 's extremely enjoyable .
the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human .
i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing .
while this is probably director gus van sant 's most conservative film ( you 'd hardly know it 's the same director of " to die for , " the only van sant film i 've seen , really ) , it 's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what 's this " best picture " deal ? ) .
and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .

when quentin tarantino made " pulp fiction " , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time .
but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to " citizen kane " , hear me out .
much like " citizen kane " , " pulp fiction " has changed movie making forever .
but i think the latter has had a tad more impact .
" pulp fiction " has actually ushered in a new era of film making .
it has altered the way films will be viewed .
" fiction " has spawned so many imitations , i 've lost count .
sure , some have been excellent ( " bound " and " the usual suspects " spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes " pulp fiction " as the original neo-noir of the 90s .
in this review , i hope to change all the people 's minds who have criticized it for it 's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , is n't really that graphic ) .
the most brilliant aspect of tarantino 's masterpiece is the screenplay .
it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the " quarter pounder with cheese " speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it is n't already .
the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine .
the first , titled " vincent vega and marcellus wallace 's wife " , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim 's .
they talk for a while ( with the occasional " uncomfortable silence " ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror .
after giving marcellus ' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a " speech impediment " .
they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic " you never can tell " .
i wo n't reveal the rest of the story , but i 'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win .
the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the " die hard " flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge .
previously in the film ( like i said , it 's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match .
as it turns out , he not only does n't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent .
he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend 's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence .
on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus .
the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous " gimp " scene , which is very reminicent of the " squeal like a pig ! "
scene from " deliverance " .
the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car .
they seek help with a friend of jackson 's ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball .
they end up calling a " cleaner " of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out .
in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began .
if you have n't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition .
it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen .
earlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago .
what the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable .
that version cut out , like , half the movie .
what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing .
for instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses .
this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place .
just a theory . . .
one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e .
" psycho " " kiss me deadly " , " deliverance " , etc . ) .
but why should n't he ?
it 's not like he out-right and blatantly stole .
give the guy a break .
in case you have n't already noticed , i believe " pulp fiction " is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as " casablanca " and " the godfather " ) .
trust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s .
and besides , it 's one hell of a ride .
note : if anyone knows how i could get a " bad motherfucker " wallet , please e-mail me .
any help would be greatly appreciated .

i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean 's war picture .
i still think that it does n't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute 's list of the 100 greatest american movies .
and i think that lumet 's " 12 angry men " , wilder 's " witness for the prosecution " and kubrick 's " paths of glory " would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 .
but i ca n't deny the importance of " the bridge on the river kwai " - cinematically and in its contents .
the film is set in burma in 1943 .
a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .
but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers need n't work as simple workmen .
struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect .
afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .
he considers it an opportunity to raise his men 's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese .
but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . .
a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .
they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .
and the film does n't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in " paths of glory " .
lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .
this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito .
in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film .
the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson 's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .
the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men .
( the plot by-passes these risks . )
that means , the picture is n't perfect .
but it has a lot of virtues as well .
it shows the " madness " of war and what war can produce in people 's minds .
it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .
and " the bridge on the river kwai " is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests .
these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .
david lean 's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown .
alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .
the other actors deliver very good performances as well .
jack hildyard 's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful .
i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it 's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo .
we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo 's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control .
however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade .
no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins .
it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas 's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time .
we 're the fans , not the freaks .
we wo n't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we wo n't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we 're throwing down .
all right , stop looking at me like that .
we have been faithfully and patiently waiting .
waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll .
you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah .
unfortunately , it is not our savior .
for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good .
anything less and it 'll be the biggest disappointment of the century .
i did n't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i did n't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking .
character development is virtually nonexistent .
with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film 's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions .
none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all .
contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala .
jar jar 's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) .
his speech mannerisms are so " cute-ified " that i could n't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting .
his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as " deep doo doo , " and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport .
therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors .
in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a " wretched hive of scum and villainy . "
in the phantom menace , we get doo doo .
the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story " a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . "
this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it 's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience .
perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it 's kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play .
i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ?
the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction .
this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me .
i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ?
did n't millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ?
did n't the action figures still sell like hotcakes ?
of course they did , and it 's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults .
one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects .
the people at lucas 's industrial light and magic , the world 's premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage .
some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation 's robot army and jar jar 's countrymen .
the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer .
this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today .
john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can .
his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately .
since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar .
as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin .
it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films .
one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film 's release .
in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost did n't have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant .
he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean .
with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment .
lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout .
however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection .
oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body 's cells .
this only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection .
do n't let me mislead you too far .
the phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film .
it contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends .
it 's just that when held up to it 's predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales .

american pie acknowledges a cold , hard fact that most movies do n't : it is very difficult to get laid .
its four virgin heroes are jim ( biggs ) , a chronic masturbator , kev ( nicholas ) , who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend ( reid ) , oz ( klein ) , a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning , and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) , a germphobe ( his crass nickname is hilarious , but i wo n't spoil it here ) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member .
jim , kev , oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women it 's no wonder they 're horny all the time .
after a party at their studly friend stifler 's ( seann william scott , in the film 's sharpest performance ) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied , the quartet make a pact : to " lose it " by graduation-specifically , prom night , which is only a few weeks away .
american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds .
almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin ' whoopee .
all women are there to be ogled .
( alyson hannigan 's perky music student is the only memorable female of the bunch . )
situations abound that defy logic only to arouse and/or amuse its core audience , adolescent boys .
( to arouse : nadia 's ( shannon elizabeth ) internet striptease-an unexpectedly raucous ( and guiltily pleasurable ) sequence .
to amuse : jim 's lusty encounter with a hot apple pie . )
what differentiates american pie from those dirty eighties comedies , aside from a very nineties obsession with bodily fluids * , is a cast that 's light years more appealing than that of , say , just one of the guys .
two more standouts : klein and " sctv " 's eugene levy .
klein plays a kind-hearted athlete for the second time in a row , after alexander payne 's underappreciated election .
i hope to see more of this warm actor with the disarmingly honest face very soon .
levy 's is the most crowd-pleasing performance , and indeed , it 's nice to see him back on the big screen in a role that makes wonderful use of that expressive brow .
american pie also wants to emulate the teen flicks your parents _would_ let you watch growing up .
it skillfully employs a broad mix of pop tunes , much like john hughes ' movies did , and even pays homage to the breakfast club a couple of times , most evidently when the prom band covers simple minds ' " do n't you ( forget about me ) . "
the picture ultimately has a healthy , if obligatory , attitude towards safe sex-even at their most libidinous , american pie 's protagonists first whip out a condom .
the filmmakers prove that socially responsible raunch is possible .
for its familiarity and for its charming leads , i recommend american pie , but the buzz on this film had me expecting something . . . fresher .
as far as the new teen cinema goes , it 's at the top of the heap .
* do n't say i did n't warn you about the party scene .

not too many people know who james whale is , but it 's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies .
if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way .
this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie .
gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale 's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it 's probably a better movie for it .
it 's focus is on whale 's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) .
it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to " sit for him , " ( pose for a portrait ) .
at first , boone does n't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man .
when he does discover whale 's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy .
but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale 's " locker room talk . "
boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned " locker room talk , " and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening .
meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago .
his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor .
what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser 's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) .
i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here .
this is impressive because his character 's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking .
that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well .
this is not to ignore mckellan 's oscar nominated turn .
he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem .
whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield .
he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people .
in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .

it is with hesitance that i call " apocalypse now " a masterpiece .
certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970 's .
the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad 's " heart of darkness " , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war .
" apocalypse " certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history .
the plot is fairly simple .
captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty .
his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) " with extreme prejudice " .
along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies .
willard ' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz ' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives .
willard 's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending .
the movie is visually breathtaking .
the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate .
the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening .
the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie .
the journey to kurtz ' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character .
the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission .
it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie .
the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne .
the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz .
coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like " saving private ryan " on lsd .
the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution .
the problems come when the film slows down .
one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess .
the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film .
the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound .
the film slows down to a drag .
sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received .
brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic .
the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief .
sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told .
the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations .
granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion .
brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ?
there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene .
there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending .
the finest scene at the end is sheen 's escape , and his entrace into the temple .
his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film .
yet , you can not shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done .
the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good .
it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man 's mental stamina during bouts of war .
but one still can not shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for .
there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding .

metro i 've seen san francisco in movies many times .
there was 1994 's interview with the vampire and most recently the rock .
now , yet again , san francisco is the setting for this movie .
eddie murphy stars as inspector scott roper of the sfpd . he is their top hostage negotiator , and the very best at what he does .
when his best friend on the force is killed by joe ( michael wincott , in a terrific performance ) , a psychotic , demented jewel thief , roger makes it his mission to capture the guy before he strikes again .
meanwhile , roper tries to rekindle a relationship with his british ex-girlfriend veronica , while helping to rear a new up and comer from swat who 's an expert sniper and marksman ( michael rappaport ) .
despite the obligatory cop movie scenes ( does every cop/new partner movie have to start the same way ? )
where the sgt .
assigns roper a partner , roper confronts the sarge , etc . , this film is still one heck of an explosive ride .
a scene involving a cable car has to be seen to be believed , and boasts some amazing car stunts .
eddie murphy shines in this tailor-made role , and for once , his character shows depth and concern .
when confronting joe in prison , you can feel the anger drip from every word .
michael rappaport is basically throwaway .
he serves no purpose , except to be buddy to murphy and get disabled in the final reel so that eddie can save the day .
typical action escapist fare .
michael wincott offers the best performance as the crazed killer and jewel thief joe .
never before have i seen such a villian written like this where i could actually believe that he was serious and take him seriously .
maybe i just thought that this role was different due to wincott 's perfectly raspy voice .
i do n't know .
what i do know , though , is that although metro is basically a typical action retread , it manages to cover new ground and shed new light on tired old cliches ' .
the film is a triumph , and an entertaining one at that .
it does n't meander or trail off from its main character .
an enjoyable two hours , metro is enjoyable , witty , action-packed , and fun , and makes for a great action movie that 's perfect for all of us that need an escape from reality .

the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily .
three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making .
they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house .
from there , things become a little more complicated .
i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me .
although i know it was all a staged " mockumentary " , there 's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you .
i did n't feel much upon initially watching it .
i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts .
i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend .
i 've gotten chills every time i 've brought it up since then .
this is not a movie that hits you right away .
instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it 's way up into your mind .
this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch .
the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so do n't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work .
this is as real as it gets folks .
i do n't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera .
the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not .
this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera .
the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen .
word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release .
i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd 's .
i know i 'll be first in line to buy one .

" the fugitive " is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made .
it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that 's totally believable throughout .
this is n't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly .
harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife .
the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner .
we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble 's perspective .
hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble 's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered .
we do n't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story .
in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble 's innocence ourselves .
the film does n't spend much time on the details of kimble 's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story .
one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck .
but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch .
this movie is so incredible because it 's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable .
tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives .
from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur .
kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other .
most of the film deals with richard 's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife .
ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy 's script and davis 's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is .
just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting .
we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we .
meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down .
at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them .
he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery .
one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor .
there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) .
they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner .
the final act concludes with another terrific chase .
richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved .
the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we do n't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together .
maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it .
we 're so relieved when justice is served .
it 's not the plot is that makes " the fugitive " great , it 's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story .
watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous .
if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .

when i first heard that disney 's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified .
i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) .
that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation .
when i saw the trailers , i was thinking " hmm . . .
this is n't bad at all .
this just might have potential . "
when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features .
i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ?
i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch .
phil collins ' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs .
the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original .
so , the soundtrack was n't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with .
this film could be good . . .
but will it be ?
when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney 's tarzan is surprisingly decent .
the story starts out with tarzan 's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace .
however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan 's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him .
kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure .
" it 's not our kind , " he says .
he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but " that does n't make him my son . "
tarzan grows up , vowing to be " the best ape ever " , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just ca n't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle .
one day , a new animal shows up : humans .
this is where jane comes into the picture .
she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas .
tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other .
even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong .
clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them .
worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money .
will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ?
i 'm not gon na tell you , sorry .
you 're gon na have to see for yourself .
and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) .
the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in .
in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox 's anastasia and dreamworks ' prince of egypt .
could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ?
the casting is fairly good .
tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules .
nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) .
lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson 's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping .
minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane .
i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i did n't have a problem with her .
i take back my insult on driver .
it 's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney 's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter .
on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton .
he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he 's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed 's vocal work contributes greatly .
but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk .
she also has a fiesty attitude ( " i 'm gon na kill ya ! "
she says , more than once ) .
i almost sung along with her during one of the film 's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human 's camp , via song , er , scatting " shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah " .
i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she 's a good singer .
not that she was the only funny character in the film , though .
wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into " un-sanitary " water .
( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) .
the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins .
this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing .
i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace .
the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules .
if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the 'n sync version of " trashing the camp " from the film .
i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be .
i was upset that it was n't , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'n sync to see tarzan .
oh , well . . .
overall , i was enthralled with tarzan .
i would n't hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney 's greatest achievements .
i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough 's tarzan .

when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space .
it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver .
but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet .
austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i 've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks .
if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ?
-- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex .
even more to this movie 's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery .
the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody .
all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america .
ironically , powers ' " yeeeeah baby , yeah ! "
has almost become an icon of the late 90s .
thus another installment was inevitable , but it 's also undoubtedly welcome .
the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life .
it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones .
austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you 'll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen .
he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again .
surprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin .
he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie .
perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately .
instead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe .
the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that 's okay by me because the original left us wanting more .
by the time that one was over we have n't had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers ' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites .
even by its conclusions , i 'm still not sure i 've had my fill of bits like " do you smoke after sex ? "
" i do n't know , baby , i never looked . "
this may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny .
i do n't know if i 've ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious " just the two of us " rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named " mini-me " .
i do n't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort .
indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did .
but as far as i 'm concerned , that is enough .

> from the man who presented us with henry : the portrait of a serial killer ( 6 . 5/10 )
comes a wild tale set within the elite and white trash of florida 's south coast .
plot : guidance counselor ( dillon ) is accused of raping one of his students .
she happens to be the daughter of one of the wealthiest women in florida .
the counselor is brought to court on the charges , as another white trash girl ( campbell ) , also joins the rape finger-pointing club .
as the story unfolds , we find that many things are n't exactly as they seem ( that 's as much as i could say without ruining anything ) .
critique : good little flick that slows down at certain points , and runs a tad long , but generates enough twists and turns to keep most people interested throughout .
mind you , i could see many people not liking it because it takes " one too many " twists and turns , but hey , i happen to like that kind of thing .
and besides , the twists and turns in this movie managed to remain within the realm of believability ( or scathingly close to ) , and even " explained " many of its turns with a showcase of missed scenes during the credit crawl at the end of the film ( do not leave the theatre before you see the credits . . . it
really does clear up some stuff ! ! ) .
other than that , the acting was good , with campbell transforming her " good girl stereotypical " role into a pot-smoking , goth-looking white trash chick out for a good time .
denise richards ( from starship troopers ( 7/10 ) fame ) solidifies herself as hollywood 's jelly-donut pinup girl of the moment , and proves that all breast implants need n't lead to lawsuits .
bacon is solid , and so is dillon ( while continuing to prove his inability to age to the whole wide wondering world ! ! ) .
sprinkle the story with a bunch o ' shots of alligators peeking through the swamp waters , bacon showing the world the size of his ding-dong ( do we really need to see this ? ? ) , a couple of lesbian kissing scenes , and a menage-a-trois , and you 've got yourself a decent time at the movie theatre .
on the down side , the soundtrack was not as prominent ( or slick ) as i thought it would be , and theresa russell ( real name : theresa paup ) seems to have lost her way in every which way possible . . . . ooooh ,
i almost forgot bill murray 's exquisite role as the down-trodden lawyer who agrees to defend dillon in court .
murray actually added that extra little spice of humour that allowed this film to affirm its position as a quirky little noirish tale of sex , greed and mystery .
little known facts : neve campbell specified a non-nudity clause in her contract ( she 's also born in guelph , ontario . . . go
hoser ! )
director john mcnaughton says he deleted a scene that would have shown matt dillon and kevin bacon showering together , as it was gratuitous .
kevin bacon plays in a band with his brother , called the bacon brothers , is married to actress kyra sedgwick , and has a game based on him called " six degrees of kevin bacon " .

it 's a fact that a good thriller or action movie does n't need violence to be good or worth watching .
all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails .
and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ?
and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon .
a computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades .
but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it .
instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad .
with the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer )
i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema .
it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that has n't changed .
of course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 .
i would n't be surprised if this gave people nightmares .
i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon .
broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) .
but the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups .
david 's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky 's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . strangelove .
if for no other reason , you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days .
david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers .
the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on .
far from any 56k modem my guess is that it 's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum .
the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it 's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today .
what are the lessons we can learn from wargames ?
1 .
make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers .
2 . thank you , whoever it was , for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers !

fritz lang 's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town .
joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago .
he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but ca n't save up enough money to marry her .
she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher .
before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye .
a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station .
driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand .
but the deputy sheriff " buggs " meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him .
he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl .
the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect .
locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence .
in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping .
fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they ca n't get through to the prisoner 's jail cell .
the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it would n't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him .
somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies .
katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died .
the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses .
joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge .
he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob .
an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder .
katherine , not knowing he 's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death .
the defense claims that it ca n't be a charge of murder without a corpse .
the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they could n't have been at the jail .
the sheriff also lies , saying he ca n't identify anyone in the mob .
but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film .
as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe .
in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive .
when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened .
katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have .
but do n't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive .
mgm could n't bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching .
instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script .
to lang 's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook .
his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised .
you could n't help get the feeling that the citizens did n't care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves .
their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they were n't going to be convicted .
lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident .
he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience .

veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort .
when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who 's just lost his cubs .
eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake .
he gets my vote , at least , partly because ` ev ' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora ) .
when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session .
the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk .
eastwood furrows his brow .
as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent .
he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum 's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman 's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand .
but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ?
jeter does n't know what he 's talking about .
eastwood furrows his brow .
crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime .
the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs .
isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments .
but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him .
denis leary , as everett 's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) .
but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera .
playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines .
when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer 's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive .
eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he did n't need to switch lanes .
true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star .
this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) .

as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences .
you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a " to kill " list for his enemies .
oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century .
as gibson delivers lines like , " before this war is over , i am going to kill you , " schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind .
oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure .
at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun .
i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend .
some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it .
like emmerich 's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all .
sure it 's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism .
and is n't that the point of the patriot ?
gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away .
he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) .
as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields .
but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) .
forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army .
the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right .
every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis ' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment .
and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable .
as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done .
clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating .
you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period .
everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge .
it 's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective .
there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin 's take-no-prisoners method .
what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington .
played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact .
this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil .
his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as " cowardly " and " sadistic . "
i disagree with this accusation .
tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general .
besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized .
and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ?
heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ?
the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks .
with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it 's a lethal weapon for the colonial times .
god bless america !
and god bless the patriot !

let 's face it : the $ 100 million-plus smash that was " goldeneye " was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , " a view to a kill " or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing .
but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie .
the new " m " is a woman ) .
" tomorrow never dies " is the picture " goldeneye " should have been ; it 's also the most entertaining bond outing since " the spy who loved me " .
the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine .
as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media .
carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars ' german scientist from " dr .
strangelove " ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) .
it 's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women .
enter michelle yeoh , fresh from " supercop " , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero .
they make a great team .
" tomorrow never dies " is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of " turner & hooch " .
spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in " goldeneye " .
moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language .
returned in brosnan 's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv 's " remington steele " , as has his deadpan wit .
and though carver 's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that " genius is insanity with some success " , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain .
in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures .
there a few too many explosions in " tomorrow never dies " , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue .
and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here .
as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i 'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed .
now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . .
it 's time to put them to use in something truly special .
there 's no mistaking , however , that " tomorrow never dies " is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you 'll walk out wanting more bond movies .

kevin smith is like a big kid .
his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile 's .
he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few .
he also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith 's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups .
smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong .
kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he 'll be the first to tell you that .
that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed .
great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them .
this was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well .
that is not to say smith 's message is a bad one .
in dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god 's desires is superior to anyone else 's .
basically , dogmatism is bad .
changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not .
this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma 's protesters are proving smith 's point .
smith 's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book .
but this is smith 's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns .
the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) .
along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany 's aid .
fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery .
the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith 's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum .
among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men .
of course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself .
they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic .
smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie .
when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters ' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke .
the film 's humor is uneven .
some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance .
but many of the film 's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek 's serendipity .
also , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away .
still , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace .
among the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far .
fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight .
damon and affleck are fairly lackluster .
rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith .
but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith 's movies , are much more in line with smith 's brand of humor .
bud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances .

note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .
be forewarned .
" all the world 's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts " - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7
when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash .
this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show .
truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life .
he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise .
or so it would seem .
bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman 's life .
a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky .
a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated ' follows him around .
a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move .
for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be .
the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next .
balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy .
in many ways , mr . niccol 's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea .
although the film 's rather conventional climax does n't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception .
despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible .
the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false .
the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs .
the system formula .
while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking .
the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman 's growing awareness is n't exactly convincing .
there 's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film .
in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman 's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling .
still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city .
i 've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans .
cheerfully going over the top , it 's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she 'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ?
ms . linney is a delight in the film .
but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here .
he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it 's difficult not to root for truman .
in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there 's an early scene where he 's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags .
it 's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who 's constantly the centre of attention .
in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman 's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz 's original score .
technical credits are first-rate all around .
while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it 's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965 's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner .
all the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent .
the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film 's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it 's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario .
perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question .
perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world .

mars attacks !
( 1996 ) - c : jack nicholson , glenn close , annette bening , martin short , danny devito , rod steiger , pierce brosnan , sarah jessica parker , michael j . fox , jim brown , pam grier , joe don baker , natalie portman , christina applegate , lisa marie , tom jones .
this is director tim burton 's finest film to date .
many will compare this tale of martians who invade earth to independence day , but even though the stories are similar , they really are two distinctly different films .
however as a whole , mars attacks is much more entertaining than id4 , and i loved id4 .
you really have to be in the right frame of mind to enjoy this film .
it is completely wacked-out and unlike anything you 've ever seen .
once the silly tone of the film is set , it 's easy to just sit back and throw logic out the window because logic and comedy just do n't mix .
the plot is simple : martians invade the earth .
but it 's different than any other invasion film .
usually it 's the evil aliens versus the heroic humans .
this time however , it 's the goofy aliens versus the equally goofy humans .
the martians , who are all computer generated , are just about the funniest things i 've seen in a long time .
they look funny , they move funny , and their " language " is hilarious .
and about the special effects .
the effects in mars attacks !
are just about the most flawless ones i 've seen to date .
the computer animation of the martians combined with the goofy personalities they are given makes them seem 100 % real .
there are just a couple of scenes that do n't work , mainly those involving sarah jessica parker and pierce brosnan on board an alien ship .
also , glenn close overacts tremendously in her ( thankfully ) very limited screen time , so much so that i actually applauded silently when her character meets her demise .
but there are many big laughs in the film , as i said , if you are in the right mood .
could it have been funnier ?
certainly .
was it funny enough ?
yes .
was i entertained ?
absolutely .
on a personal note , i 'd like to thank whomever cast rod steiger ( my favorite actor ) in the film as war-crazy general decker .
finally , after many very small parts in direct to video garbage and minor tv roles , steiger is back on the big screen in a real movie that many people will see .
while he 's not given the type of role that you can give a real " performance " in , he does the job well and has some good lines of dialogue .
the preview audience i saw the film with really seemed to enjoy him .

with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late '90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically .
for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer 's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards .
lola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day .
it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he does n't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed .
this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies .
so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she 'll be able to obtain the money and save a life .
> from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like " sliding doors on steroids .
with a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something .
indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious .
very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film .
the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer 's movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) .
thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash .
while you are watching , this will not matter .
running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted .
it is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers .

eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only .
coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox 's animated film anastasia was released .
you know disney , they ca n't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old " masterpiece " from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox .
let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market .
they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place .
believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time .
it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom 's friends for a couple weeks .
they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times .
by the time i got back home , i promised myself i 'd never see the movie .
but promises are made to be broken , especially when you 're looking at a 17-day , limited engagement .
damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games .
the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it 's disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song .
it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times .
i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . .
the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase .
she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans .
she 's also dealing with feelings she has n't had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you did n't use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) .
her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the " savage " humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating .
what 's a king to do , though ?
the girl 's in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world does n't deter her .
ariel saves the prince 's life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him .
she makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) .
you know she 's evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history .
she also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl 's corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out .
she 'll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever .
and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she 'll fall asleep forever .
it 's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company .
it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the '50s .
all the elements are there -- memorable songs like " under the sea " and " kiss the girl , " cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children .
the little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left .
serving america for more than 1/25th of a century !

capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be .
makes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence .
" serial killer chic " is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones .
i 've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry .
i was n't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero .
thankfully , that 's not the way henry works .
the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work .
it does n't provide cheap-jack explanations for henry 's behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him .
at the film 's opening , henry 's friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago .
in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers .
they are damned together from that moment on .
henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun .
the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there 's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv .
the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron .
no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker .
in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment .
the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation .
henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting .
michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well .
the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly did n't see release .
the film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was .
i 'm hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of " victim " or " hero " .
then again , probably , so would henry .

lisa cholodenko 's " high art , " is an intelligent , quiet drama .
its strongest quality , aside from the top-notch central performances , is the perceptive way in which the film , also written by cholodenko , observes its characters .
they are all flawed people , some more troubled than others , but they are not judged .
judging the characters in this picture would be a creative misstep on the filmmakers ' parts , because no one , no matter how bad off they are , deserve to be negatively judged if they are involved in some serious problems that they can not break free of .
syd ( radha mitchell ) , a 24-year-old woman living with her longtime boyfriend james ( gabriel mann ) , has recently been awarded an ideal job at the high-profile photography magazine , " frame . "
she very much enjoys where her career is headed , but is often not taken very seriously by her managers , who are always giving her petty jobs to do , when she knows she could be doing more important things .
one night , while taking a bath , syd notices a leak coming from the apartment above hers , so when she goes up there to inform them of it , she meets lucy beliner ( ally sheedy ) , a thin , worn-out , and unhappy woman , who lives with her drug-addicted german girlfriend , greta ( patricia clarkson ) , a pathetic former actress who is usually so out-of-it that she often is in and out of conciousness .
syd quickly strikes up a conversation with lucy , and discovers that she used to be an acclaimed photographer ten years before .
lucy claims she does n't want to get back into the profession , but syd manages to convince the " frame " editors to do a piece on her work .
all the while , syd begins to grow deep feelings for lucy , even though she has never previously been attracted to a woman , and lucy starts a battle with her personal demons .
" high art , " is such an effective motion picture because it is never suger-coated or idealized , but instead an honest and convincing portrait of a handful of unhappy people whose lives are going nowhere , while syd 's luck begins to rise .
the film in no way is about lesbianism , but about love , which was a refreshing change of pace from the usual stereotypical portraits of homosexuality .
as lucy and syd grow closer and closer together , we really do believe that they are falling in love with each other , even if the relationship might be doomed .
with this picture , ally sheedy 's star has risen once again , thanks to her touching , nearly flawless portrtayal of lucy , a woman who , in the course of a decade , has found her life consumed almost entirely by drugs , which has taken away her once-blossoming career .
her characted really is tragic , and one particular scene involving lucy and her mother , in which lucy admits to her that she has a drug problem , and her mother matter-of-factly responds by saying she ca n't help her , is heartbreaking .
although not autobiographical , sheedy has had drug problems in her past , and i suspect she brought that knowledge of already being in lucy 's footsteps to her role .
also very good is radha mitchell as syd , who previously starred in the slight 1997 australian comedy , " love and other catastrophes , " wh caught me by surprise with her performance .
easily being able to pass as christina ricci 's older sister , mitchell obtains the same natural charisma that has made ricci so popular recently .
as accurate as almost every detail is in , " high art , " i wish the relationship had been more tightly written involving syd and james , who , played by gabriel mann , is left with a throwaway role .
by the time he finds out about syd and lucy , he disappears from the film , and i wish there had been another scene where they confronted each other .
this is a very minor fault , however , in a film that is full of riches .
although many of the characters are stuck in a hopeless pit of despair , syd and lucy are intelligent people who recognize their problems .
the character of dominique ( anh duong ) , the " frame " editor who decides to give syd a chance with her ideas , was also written to be far more mature than expected .
and the one sex scene in the film was beautifully and originally done .
for once , it did not invlove steaminess , or violent sexual activity , or gratuitous nudity , but focused on the actual characters , who love each other , and their insecurities involved in making the decision to actually have sex .
" high art , " which won the screenwriting award at the 1998 sundance film festival , marks the superior feature film debut of cholodenko , as well as sheedy 's strongest , and best , role to date .

" oh my god , i sounded just like a mother ! "
mrs . pascal , played with devilish wickedness by genevieve bujold , tells her son .
" did n't i sound just like a mother ? "
" you are a mother , " her son marty tells her disgustedly .
" i know , but i still ca n't believe it .
i look at you people and wonder , how did you ever fit in my womb ? "
marty , you see , is a grown-up twin .
although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes .
mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko .
most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is .
the daughter 's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being .
mrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level .
she explains to marty 's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty 's private part when she came out of the womb .
the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment .
the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters .
the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family 's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane .
in this storm are two sane individuals .
the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o 's bitter pseudo-sophistication .
as the two twins ' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother 's fiancee that night .
" we all have our secrets , " jackie-o tells her potential sister-in-law , and boy , does she have a few .
this is a house filled with them .
( when lesly calls it the family 's " home " to mrs . pascal -- they 've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their " house . " )
in a film that gives new meaning to the phrase , " made for each other , " the twin 's biggest , but not their only secret , is that they 've had a long-term incestuous relationship .
they do n't like to discuss it , although they are not particularly ashamed of it .
perfect for viewers who can appreciate perverse comedy , this story never pulls its punches .
jackie-o tries in many ways , few subtle , to show that she is a better match for marty than that ditzy fiancee of his .
in one scene marty and lesly are playing chop sticks together on the piano when jackie-o pushes her aside and starts playing a challenging classical piece for four hands .
marty joins her as his fiancee looks on with envy .
the chemistry between parker posey and josh hamilton is nothing short of amazing .
they put down their little brother and most of the other sane people in the world .
their ripostes are engaging filmmaking at its best .
director mark waters keeps the show 's energy level high and lets the leads sling zingers at each other at a furious pace .
his crisp direction ensures the movie has nary an ounce of fat on it .
jackie-o is temperamentally incapable of being nice .
and being jealous , she cuts lesly down mercilessly .
" were you poor ? "
jackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished .
" did you eat pies ?
chicken pot pies ? "
" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , " lesly replies with her usual sincerity .
" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , "
jackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king .
" are we entertaining royalty ? "
with rolfe kent 's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed .
will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ?
the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell .
i 'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise .
the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 .
it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity .
the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 .

with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ?
based on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years .
together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through .
set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities .
jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention .
there is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father .
the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way .
3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil .
when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder .
even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder .
the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood .
the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects .
in l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of ` story ' going for it .
there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all .
surprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather ` unknowns ' , pearce and crowe .
pearce 's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance .
crowe 's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here .
superb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever .
easily the best hollywood piece for 1997 .

118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language )
mamoru oshii is a name that probably is n't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be .
oshii was the director of last year 's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent .
one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series .
in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( " manga " ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan .
set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus .
as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan .
as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as " labors " ( an interesting play on words , considering that " robot " is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century .
with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime .
this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime .
the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness .
sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life .
those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers .
the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay .
this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization .
however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . .
shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors ' movement speed and efficiency by 30 % .
this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90 % of the nation 's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 .
since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos .
( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . )
it 's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2 's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father 's company down with it .
as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you .
_patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama .
it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) .
there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ .
this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism .
patlabor 's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day .
the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ?
are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ?
this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor 's alternate-1999 setting .
as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that 's the only one i 've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so .
the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to .
the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline .
as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ .
i do n't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all .
the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters ' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences .
the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good .
even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side .
giant robot footsteps are deep and booming .
the sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery .
as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they 're among the most easily-readable subtitles i 've ever seen for _anything_ .
large enough that they do n't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen .
although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie .
although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people 's enjoyment .

for this review and more , visit clear illusions ( www . clearillusions . com )
the majority of scary movies signal the fact that a character is about to meet their demise with cheesy music , worn out dialogue such as " i 'll be right back , " or simply with the overall tone of the scene .
how about a classic john denver song as a death signal for a change ?
that 's the kind of bursting originality that allows " final destination " to invade the viewer 's mind , even days after seeing it , making one pause before ever entering a dark room , taking a shower , or even going to sleep .
the unique and horrifying thriller is the best thing to happen to the slasher genre since 1996 's " scream . "
" final destination , " directed by james wong and penned by jeffrey riddick , glen morgan , and james wong , the latter two being writers for the t . v .
series " the x-files , " is a movie with wonderful ideas , and executes them effortlessly .
it 's rare a film of this nature can grab an audience 's attention these days , as the genre has seem to be completely worn out ? ? ` but " final destination " has more in store for one than one can imagine .
unlike " halloween " 's michael myers or " nightmare on elm street " 's freddy kruger , " final destination " 's killer is of the supernatural , the dark one himself , death .
the intriguing premise is as follows ; a portion of a senior class is set to travel by air to paris for their class trip .
after boarding the plane , one of the students , alex browning ( devon sawa ) dreams of their plane exploding into flames just after takeoff , killing everyone on board .
once waking up , alex gets himself and six others off of that plane , all of who seem to be rather confused by the entire happening .
shortly after their departure , the plane takes off , and guess what ; it blows up in middair .
now , alex , and fellow survivors , who consist of friend clear waters ( ali larter ) , enemy carter ( kerr smith ) , carter 's girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the goofy billy ( sean william scott ) and his brother tod ( chad donella ) , and teacher , ms . valerie lewton ( kristen cloke ) , are in extreme danger , as it seems they have cheated death by getting off of that plane , and now death wants them .
the number of survivors starts to peel back quite quickly as death goes around offing those who got off the plane ? ? ` but who is next , and how will death get them ?
" final destination " is a film that is unbearably suspenseful ; always making the viewer frantic , as death will strike in the most unlikely of times .
john denver 's " rocky mountain high " being played pretty much warrants another death ? ? ` everyone on that plane learned the hard way .
although it 's usually given whose life will be taken next , the intensity and unpredictability of the film never fades , because you do n't know when death is coming .
like the characters in the movie , i was constantly nervous and shaky during " final destination " .
the slightest noise or movement nearby would send me a mile into the air ? ? ` and yes , the film is that intense .
the cast is surprisingly effective and up to par ; the best ensemble in this genre since " scream . "
the characters have multi-dimensional personalities for a change , and for the most part , you highly sympathize with them once death starts to come their way .
devon sawa and ali larter are the main focus of the film , and both actors follow up their well written characters with even better performances , that , like the " scream " movies did for their cast , will launch them into superstardom .
kerr smith and kristen cloke are also impressive , although the two do n't posses as much screen time as the leads .
" final destination " is one exhilarating , exciting ride .
any age should be able to enjoy the complexity and eeriness of the film , and should find an edge to it that most slasher films lack .
for the blood loving moviegoer , " destination " contains buckets of blood , guts , and all that good stuff .
" final destination " is a film that is destined to become a cult classic among horror fans , and a sleeper hit at the box office .
hands down to the first film in years that has actually scared me .
by scare , i do n't mean making me jump , or making me wonder if i 'm in danger , but by scare i mean a film that stays locked in your mind , absorbing you , leaving one question that 's constantly on your mind : is death coming for me ?
the bottom line : make " final destination " your destination .

mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er .
her mast famous episode , " love 's labour lost " , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child .
the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing .
there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood 's big blockbuster movies .
so it 's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster .
and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint .
peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new .
the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen .
despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent .
it 's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better .
once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off .
george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world .
he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters .
nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling .
there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly .
the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney
goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt .
this is when leder starts to show her true stuff .
she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer .
then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter .
then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city 's crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them .
mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense .
she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking .
nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero .
you 're not gon na find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her .
george clooney is a real movie star .
many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real .
he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality .
he 'll be around for a while .
dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .

a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today 's youth seem attracted to black culture .
the review
if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act .
however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that .
black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america 's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious .
featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback 's is a complex film worth seeing .
black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman .
there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game .
this eventually spills over into the life of dean 's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem .
rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf .
meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) .
others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean 's girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . .
mike tyson .
the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time .
friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence .
originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls .
while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing .
the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point .
the frequent sex is one of the film 's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film .
to toback 's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil .
these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way .
whenever a character finds himself on donager 's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea .
charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that " in ten years time , i 'll be way over this . "
these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it .
toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny .
most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film 's comic relief without really trying .
he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson 's image as a dimwit .
but tyson also gets the film 's scariest moment .
as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm .
the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction .
the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr 's face turns a frightening shade of purple .
black & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film 's omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this .
but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character 's struggle .
thus black & white 's message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself .
toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way .
and we do .

i 'll be the first to admit i did n't expect much from the emperor 's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald 's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume .
i was dead wrong about all of those things .
the emperor 's new groove is funny .
damn funny .
and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones .
the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing .
the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over .
the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us .
the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia .
here 's the plot ; try to follow along .
set in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor .
when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her " assistant " kronk ( seinfeld 's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama .
kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco 's water world theme park , to save him .
then the fun starts .
for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination .
yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl .
the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) .
david spade and john goodman 's character interactions make you feel like you 're watching an old hope/crosby film .
spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times .
needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days .
the best part about the emperor 's new groove is how audacious the film is .
the sheer weirdness factor is very high .
cross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah 's boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal .
simply put , the emperor 's new groove is one of the best children 's films out for this holiday season .
kids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue .
that 's a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it .

an astonishingly difficult movie to watch , the last temptation of = christ may be scorsese 's most important film , and yet his most = impossibly abstract as well .
scorsese presents the life of jesus = christ , through nikos kazantzakis ' novel , which details the life of = christ from approximately 20 until the day of crucifixtion .
jesus of = nazareth ( dafoe ) is a carpenter , who opens the film making crosses , so = that he can escape the fate he is subjected to , his destiny on earth .
= yet , he soon learns his evil ways for aiding in the deaths of others , = and subjects himself to a desert in exile , in hopes that he can reach = god .
before leaving , he asks for forgiveness from mary magdelene = ( barbara hershey ) , a prostitute who is also a childhood friend of jesus .
= = 20
after going to the desert , christ learns his true purpose in life , = and what he must do .
aided by judas ( keitel ) , he sets off on teaching = the world his message .
along the way , he meets john the baptist , the = rest of the prophets , and tries to teach the world his message .
christ = is also confronted by internal demons and self-doubt , as he tries to = find his true purpose throughout the entire film .
during the story , = judas is the closese ally of jesus : his betrayal , argues the film , was = not out of hate , but out of love , in order to allow christ to die .
= 20
he is eventually captured , and crucified as per the bibile .
= however , as he is about to die on the cross , he is saved by a girl , who = brings him to his marriage with mary magdelene .
the girl is a guardian = angel who is from god , and who has saved him from his death .
jesus goes = on to live a life as a man , as a carpenter , and does not die on the = cross .
on his deathbed , in the final moments of his life , he is visited = by the prophets , and by judas , who denounces his master for " not keeping = his end of the bargain . "
judas reveals the angel to truly be the devil , = and the life jesus had lived to be the ultimate selfish act .
jesus = escapes from his deathbed , and asks his father for forgiveness , for = succumbing to his last temptation .
visually and aurally , the film is absolutely breathtaking .
no other = director has even come close to realizing jerusalem during the time of = christ 's life to the screen .
peter gabriel contributes a score than is = simply astonishing , with pulsing rhythms that capture the viewer .
the = performances are simply exquisite , with dafoe leading the way with a = mesmerizing turn as jesus .
keitel , although his accent is a problem , is = passionately brilliant , fighting through language to bring the character = to life .
the visuals are also amazing .
scorsese frames his movie in a = harsh tone , leaving the impression that jesus truly is a man who is = having human frailties .
the film , though , has many trouble spots .
paul schrader 's script is = one .
schrader uses modern-day new york english to tell the story , along = with new york words , new york mannerisms , and new york slang speech .
= the film also does not focus on the godly aspects of christ .
there is = no underlying message behind the man 's words .
the film fails to capture = the glory and splendor of christ .
had it faithfully explored that = aspect , than the dichotomy of jesus ' soul , his frailties and doubt mixed = with his unmistakable glory , would have been simply spectacular .
the = message of christ is confused between love and violence , and the film = merely tells us jesus is great , instead of showing us his greatness .
the film is also overlong .
it just drags in the middle , with = nothing truly happening .
christ is a confused figure , in the sense that = the audience does n't know who he really is .
schrader forgets to give = jesus a message , to show that he truly is the messiah , to give him the = divinity .
without that , he is a rambling prophet , who the audience = themselves do not believe .
there are several moments of accidental = hilarity , and most of them occur when jesus is attempting to preach .
= there are moments of brief awe and power , followed by moments of = confused hilarity .
that said , the controversial temptation sequence is something to = behold .
it is a step in an unexpected direction , one that leaves the = audience puzzled , until the arrival of the disciples .
it is a simply = breathtaking scene , with jesus about to die as a mortal .
it is truly = one of scorsese 's finest moments .
it is unfortunate that scorsese = could n't make a film about christ as powerful as that one scene .
= 20

seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater # 2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic 's pass .
[ theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable ]
" rounders " is exactly the kind of movie parents do n't want their kids to see .
it 's not that it 's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it 's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling .
and to take make things " worse " it proves this through its original , fascinating story .
there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the " noir " mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life .
this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing .
matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played .
damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting .
mike 's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer .
but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) .
damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together .
he never sounds like he 's reading from a script , nor that he 's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him .
the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys ' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite .
immediately we get the sense that poker is n't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel .
the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers .
the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man .
the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act .
it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit .
we learn only a little about mike , both past and present .
presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling .
they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike 's childhood pal and fellow rounder " worm " ( norton ) is released from prison .
it 's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does .
technically , the plot is n't unlike many children 's sitcoms in which the " good " kid 's " bad " friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid .
what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story .
mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them .
where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he 's dealt and works with them .
sometimes they pay off ( i . e .
his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they do n't ( i . e .
the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $ 30 , 000 on a single hand ) .
once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood .
mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites ' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all .
everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything 's a battle against the cards destiny deals .
one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time .
matt 's good at gambling but he 's also got potential to be a great lawyer .
he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there 's stability but not much risk involved .
can someone who 's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ?
if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test .
everything is told from mike 's perspective , but we 're finally able to recognize some things on our own .
this makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that .
it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof .
what separates " rounders " from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end .

while alex browning ( devon sawa ) waits at jfk to leave for a school trip to paris , bad omens seem to surround him .
as soon as he buckles into the plane , he has a vision of the plane exploding seconds after take-off .
when the vision begins to come true , alex bolts for the door , dragging several students and a teacher in his wake .
the plane takes off without them and explodes just as alex predicted .
he becomes an object of fear and suspicion among the community , and the tension only increases as the survivors begin to die .
alex and another survivor , clear rivers ( ali larter ) , investigate the suspicious " suicide " of a friend , and a mortician ( tony " candyman " todd ) clues them in to the truth : alex interrupted death 's design by saving people who should have died in the explosion , and death will want to claim its rightful victims .
in order to save himself and the others , alex will have to figure out death 's new plan and thwart it .
of the countless horror films that have competed for a piece of the " scream " audience , " final destination " is the best so far .
talented young screenwriter jeffrey reddick offers a fresh variation on a familiar formula .
we 've seen hundreds of movies where a group of teenagers are murdered one-by-one by a faceless slasher , but reddick cuts out the hockey-masked middle-man and makes the villain death itself .
first-time feature director james wong made the most of that premise .
every scene is permeated with creepiness and foreboding , reminding us that death is everywhere , can come at anytime .
everyday objects and events vibrate with menace .
the most amusing harbinger of doom : john denver 's " rocky mountain high , " which is played several times in the movie before someone dies .
( the link is that denver died in a plane crash , and the song includes a line about fire in the sky . )
the performances are stronger than those usually elicited by teen horror .
devon sawa , who previously starred in another horror flick , " idle hands , " gives a frantic and convincing lead performance .
kerr smith is carter hogan , an antagonist of alex 's whose quick temper causes him to pulled off the fatal plane .
smith plays carter as filled with anger and confusion that constantly threatens to bubble over into violence .
seann william scott , who 's also in theaters right now in " road trip , " plays the somewhat dim billy hitchcock and provides a needed counterpoint to the intensity of alex and carter .
tony todd 's one-scene cameo is delicious but all too brief .
bottom line : watchable teen fright flicks are few and far between , but this destination is worth visiting .

after the press screening of " moulin rouge , " i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues .
everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images .
a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it .
another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye .
when one fellow quietly stated " i 've never really been a fan of musicals , " the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i did n't think of it as a musical .
there is so much going on in " moulin rouge " that " musical " seems too small a term to cover it .
" moulin rouge " is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o ' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience .
australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind " strictly ballroom " and " romeo + juliet , " fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from " the sound of music " to " smells like teen spirit . "
sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , " moulin rogue " travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the " random " setting .
oh , and it has a story as well .
" it was 1899 , the summer of love . . .
" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , " to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , " where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) .
christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor .
at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying .
christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession .
working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named " spectacular spectacular . "
zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there 's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine .
as if all that is n't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land .
like a teeter-totter , " moulin rogue " moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime .
one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales .
together they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky .
other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload .
the cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like " bewitched " beat into the ground .
of course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind .
" we never heard from baz to turn it down , " one of the actors told the los angeles times .
" it was always , 'more !
more ! ' "
the director even sent a note to his cast reading , " i dare you to make me say you 've gone too far . "
the musical numbers reflect his attitude .
one knockout piece , the " elephant love medley , " incorporates the beatles ' " all you need is love , " u2 's " in the name of love , " dolly parton 's " i will always love you " and elton john and bernie taupin 's " your song . "
need more ?
how about " diamonds are a girl 's best friend " spiced with portions of " material girl ? "
luhrmann 's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful .
ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet .
mcgregor 's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments .
once labeled the " ice queen , " nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance .
she handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range .
veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform " like a virgin . "
as the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film 's weakest link , although i 'm sure he was simply following instructions .
i suspect " moulin rogue " will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films .
while i did n't completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot .
over the course of a year , i see well over 300 movies , and most of them look like xeroxes of each other .
" moulin rogue " is an original , and an original , even a flawed one , is a thing to be cherished .

susan granger 's review of " osmosis jones " ( warner bros . )
if the farrelly brothers taught anatomy & physiology in school , no one would cut ever class .
this hip , live action/animation story begins as a monkey snatches a hard-boiled egg from frank , a zookeeper ( bill murray ) , who grabs it back , drops it , then gobbles up the contaminated morsel , explaining , " if it hits and ground and you pick it up within 10 seconds , you can eat it . "
like " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ) , the pseudo-science animation then takes over when his body 's immune system contacts traffic control as an ingested virus hits the digestive system : " be on the alert for illegal organisms ! "
eager to right " a stomach evacuation mistake " he once made , a cocky , clever , courageous white blood cell ( chris rock ) declares , " this is a crime scene ! "
and teams up with a conscientious " phi beta capsule " 12-hour cold remedy called drixenol ( david hyde pierce ) to chase down and destroy the deadly " red death " virus ( laurence fishburne ) that 's determined to take frank down in 48 hours , beating ebola and e . coli to a medical record .
watch out for mucus mudslides , chaos in cerebellum hall and the detritus from booger dam ( runny nose ) , along with comic turns from molly shannon and chris elliot , plus the voices of william shatner and brandy norwood .
peter and bobby farrelly , along with writer mark hyman and animation directors piet kroon and tom sito , have turned their penchant for gross-out comedy , encompassing flatulence , festering sores and " popping a pimple without a permit , " into a funny , farrelly-funny family film .
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " osmosis jones " is a wildly imaginative , original , explosive 7 .
and perhaps , as they 're laughing , kids will learn where to find their uvula , along with nuggets about nutrition and hygiene .

i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files .
first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie .
the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable .
you have to reach for a larger audience .
therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly .
altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange .
but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on .
you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera .
in any case , the answer is no .
i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium .
however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie 's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie .
i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new .
everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others .
i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie .
warning : major spoilers follow !
please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird " hummm " sound is all about .
you have been warned .
the x-files is what a summer should be .
exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances .
this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank .
from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you .
when i compare it with last summer 's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon .
this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes .
in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue .
you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !
the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid .
you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ?
so yeah , the x-files is scary .
and guess what ?
you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster .
do not think that the x-files is a monster movie .
in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total .
no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series .
scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time .
she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much .
no , this is mulder 's time in the spotlight .
by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder " showers " independence day .
if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let 's just say that due to recent events mulder should be " showering " godzilla instead .
to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who
cares ! ?
if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ?
the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous .
the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill .
the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose .
if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i can not stress this enough , pay attention ! ! !
unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects .
miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense .
also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . do n't !
the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation .
there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ?
) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose .
who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a " big emotional scene " between godzilla attacks ?
so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i 'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose .
but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is .
what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ?
cool effects ?
it 's got some .
pulse pounding ?
hell yes !
strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time .
it does not provide answers to the show 's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together .
rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many " whoah , i never saw that one coming ! "
moments , four " holy shit , where the hell did that come from " and one heck of an ending .
you may wonder where this movie lost half a star .
well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop .
it 's pretty obvious the film 's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .

with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) ,
it 's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement .
with this and " crimson tide , " he 's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart .
that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant .
" enemy of the state " is the same way : it 's engrossing for its entire running time , and it 's scary the way that it shows a man 's decent into kafkaism , but it 's too technical .
it 's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be .
it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he 's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person .
i hate to do this , but last year 's film " the game " got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened .
the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year .
not that i want every kafkaesque film to be " the game " ( this year 's " the spanish prisoner " succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what does n't .
will smith 's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect .
he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless .
he has a kid , and he 's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one .
so he generally does n't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering " id4 " / " men in black " territory .
he 's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of " six degrees of separation " for proof of this , not that he is n't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities .
smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) .
the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it .
as smith 's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet .
these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they 're , well , fascinating : they 're doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film does n't view them as such , and they almost become our friends .
we like these guys for the sole reason that the film does n't automatically judge them as the villains .
they 're also scary because we get the idea that they 're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world .
it 's as if they 're obsessed with their jobs , not because they 're evil , but because , hey , it 's a fun job , and no one else can do it like them .
unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that " the game " was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on .
sure , you 're chilled , but you 're not exacty freaked out by what 's going on .
but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked .
he 's a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : " days of thunder " ) , but the reason he 's not great is because he 's too technical and calculated .
his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they 're always making sure you 're paying attention .
this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces " enemy of the state " to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems .
despite never actually becoming great , it 's never actually boring and it 's always intriguing .
watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith 's likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment .
add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you 've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith 's plight without a minute 's worth of boredom .

in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other .
each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax .
in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others .
yet the stories and where they are going are all independent .
what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized .
each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve .
while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene .
then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again .
it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked .
this creates some strange effects .
the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships .
the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content .
we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends .
phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal .
partridge 's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason .
frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women 's lib .
officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place .
jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children 's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) .
the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily .
each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story .
the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories .
the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event .
magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories .
it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson 's company .
john c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture .
particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight .
here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used .
as studies of characters these stories are each worth following .
as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired .
but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through .
i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low + 2 on the -4 to + 4 scale .
heavy spoiler . . .
heavy spoiler . . .
heavy spoiler . . .
heavy spoiler . . .
during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen .
and in actual fact , it does .
since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods .
it is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon .
the cause is associated with whirlwinds .
we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft .
the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister .
smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are .
when the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate .
essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere .
so while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in .
the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs .
it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped .
it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon .
( frankly i have no idea on these points . )
otherwise the event was quite believable .
what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano .
in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 .
" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . "
however a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent .
note that the previous verse says " and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , "
so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river .
the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 .

films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they 're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there 's never really been a comic book like from hell before .
for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .
to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .
the book ( or " graphic novel , " if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .
in other words , do n't dismiss this film because of its source .
if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell 's directors , albert and allen hughes .
getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that 's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?
the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london 's east end .
it 's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called " unfortunates " ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .
when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .
abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .
upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it is n't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon ca n't stomach .
i do n't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i wo n't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .
in the comic , they do n't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .
it 's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .
and from hell 's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( " who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? " ) .
do n't worry - it 'll all make sense when you see it .
now onto from hell 's appearance : it 's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it 's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .
the print i saw was n't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( do n't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .
oscar winner martin childs ' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .
even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .
ians holm ( joe gould 's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .
i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually was n't half bad .
the film , however , is all good .
2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content

usually when a blockbuster comes out , it 's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action .
mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year .
the film is based upon the comic book series " the flaming carrot " by bob burden , in which 3 wan na be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) .
things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city .
well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance .
this is where the film takes a turn for the better .
in the beggining , there were only 3 wan na be heroes .
" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , " mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and " the shoveller ( william h . macy ) .
sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast .
that is until they aquire " invisible boy " ( kel mitchell ) , and " the bowler " ( janeane garafalo ) and " mr . splein " ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess .
thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen .
the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest .
for one , the film is considerably clever .
it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way .
a part of the cleverness comes from the cast .
sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here .
while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out .
one was paul reuben .
no matter how disgusting or revolting " mr . splein " may be , you still ca n't help but laugh .
it ' so incredibly moronic , it 's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions .
janeane garafalo also was an interesting character .
she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing .
men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes .
on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off .
kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless .
their parts were so limited , they 'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes .
ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue .
none of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film .
as far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects .
while the set designs and action all look nice , i 'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud .
slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers .
it forgets about money making , because it 's not likely to make a bundle like it 's proceeders , and that 's what works .
stupid ?
maybe , but for once i 'm not disappointed .
no one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year .

hollywood is a pimp .
a fat , cigar-smoking chump wearing a fur hat and 12 gold chains around its fat , hairy chest .
all of its stars and starlets are an evil brood of scum-sucking vampires looking for the next percentage take , the next summer blockbuster , the next casting couch to audition on .
pumping out comic-book adaptations , terrible sequels to mediocre films , and remakes of foreign films to the nearest american movie multiplex mall theater equipped with thin walls and bad sound systems .
how much longer can the works of peckinpah , fassbinder , fuller , castle , preminger , and lee be placed and forgotten in the wrong sections of the local blockbuster stores ?
how many more silver and weinstein films can we enduring in this stinky , decaying state of american cinema ?
but now , from john " i do n't give a shit what you think about my movies " waters , comes the siren call to all frustrated filmmakers and aficionados : cecil b . demented , a warped and twisted tale of how far a filmmaker will go to create a personal vision of internal and social revolution .
stephen dorff , in a career-defining role , is cecil b . demented , a crazed director devoted to making the most radical underground film .
together with his film production cult , the sprocket holes - who wear tattoos of peckinpah , lee , fuller , castle , anger , fassbinder , preminger on various parts of their bodies as badges of honor , they kidnap a hollywood movie starlet , played with perfect ridiculousness by melaine griffith , and force her to take the starring role in demented 's film .
with no budget and no contracts for extras , demented and his crew take to the streets for production of raving beauty , a crass terrorist film about an angry owner of an independent theater and her brood out to destroy the mainstream film business .
using " ultimate reality " - with real bullets , real people , and real terror - demented and his crew of misfits attack a mall theater , terrorize the maryland film commission and crash a movie studio shooting a certain sequel to a really annoying tom hanks film .
demented 's crewmembers are maimed and killed , popcorn machines are used for target practice , and no one can have sex until the film is complete .
it 's like bowfinger , only , you know , good .
the film moves with zigs and zags like the magic bullet of kennedy 's assassination .
the zeal of demented 's cause catches quickly and conveys the urgent message of " doing something , anything , for the accomplishment of artistic motivations . "
the crewmembers all hold the quirkiness common in water 's previous films - pink flamingos , hairspray , polyester , pecker -- and speak in the choppy , jaded dialogue used frequently by waters .
it is as if water 's script strips away the unnecessary dialogue common to most pretentious indie films and just delivers the goods .
cecil takes such warped avenues of expression that it seems like it might actually outdo itself .
you can see how a major studio might take this film , re-edit it , cut a deal with the remaining crew members who are still alive , and make a few sequels , a la the blair witch project .
but that 's for the future .
overall , the ride is fantastic ; it 's one of water 's best films to date and this year 's fight club for filmmakers .
director/writer : john waters starring : stephen dorff , melaine griffith , alicia witt , adrian grenier , larry gilliard jr . , mink stole , ricki lake , kevin nealon producers : john fielder , mark tarlov , anthony delorenzo , joe caraccio jr .

what is a scary movie anyhow ?
is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ?
is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ?
possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer .
what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters .
movies like " halloween " and " psycho " which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled " the exorcist " , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 " the exorcist " comes back to the big screen in a version you 've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending .
chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan .
while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden .
when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter .
father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl .
christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl .
excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death .
now we get to the experience " the exorcist " the way it was meant to be seen in a director 's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more .
the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing .
the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness .
as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is " the exorcist " nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on .
ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in " requiem for a dream " to which she is getting rave reviews for .
jason miller ( jason patrik 's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along .
i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff !
anyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $ 40 million dollars , and is still going .
hopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .

near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king .
the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia .
at best , that 's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry .
in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different .
there have been a number of pushes on disney 's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged .
dreamworks ' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed .
the other two contenders , warner brothers ' quest for camelot and disney 's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively .
although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and ca n't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner .
unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition .
in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product .
the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug 's life , is the best-looking movie to date .
the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with .
the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot .
namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d .
dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they 've got the stuff of success , and that they 're capable of challenging disney .
the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent .
for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense .
the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way .
in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything .
moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family .
moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves .
by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention .
the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin .
the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting .
it 's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who have n't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost .
but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .

it 's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office .
a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs .
in directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie .
in addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types .
the two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together .
jackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts .
the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one .
chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there 's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who could n't believe their eyes the first time .
chris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan 's performance .
he works perfectly with the script , and it 's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines .
almost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent .
we 're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd .
cut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters .
the fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help .
the fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective .
it 's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up .
rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it does n't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year 's grosse pointe blank .
there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback .
also , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing .
however , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background .
almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it 's tucker 's toned-down routine or chan 's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types .
a recommendable visit to the theater , indeed .

just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas could n't be more appropriate .
with all of the attention thrown to " family films " in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it 's high time we raised the intellectual level of children 's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios .
with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago .
nightmare is the story of one man 's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego .
jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere .
but during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday .
after the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world .
imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around .
upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping " sandy claws , " employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children .
he then aims to take over the role as primary joy-provider and gift-bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had .
alas , the co-mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie
tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee-wee 's big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare .
originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) .
the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it 's simple yet compelling story .
the direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters .
also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing .
the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone .
it 's not just child 's play for the holidays ; it 's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , without compromise .
what better message is there for christmas ?

george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother .
after mr . and mrs . little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j . fox ) .
george is n't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane ) .
george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he 's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it 's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat ) .
stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi ) .
the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you 'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect .
there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the " supporting cast " are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak ) .
it 's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with .
stuart little is a charming family film .
there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense 's m . night shyamalan no less ! ) ,
some moments that can only be described as " too cute " ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children 's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable .
kids and parents will love this one .
stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video .
there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 66 : 1 .
both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 . 1 audio .
both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . . there 's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) .
there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . .
get it ?
it 's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . .
i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) .
dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game .
but wait . . .
there 's still more !
there 's a section called " basement treasures " where you will find the auditions of the film 's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) .
the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson .
they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film 's production .
minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) .
anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur .
the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film .
movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one .
now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now .
one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called " i need to know " by a group called r angels .
this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party .
the girls ask a ouija board " i need to know . . .
who to do , who to do , who to do " as the song begins .
they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits .
then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like " i 'll be your pleasure all the time . . .
just say the words that you 'll be mine " .
um . . .
what the hell ?
what does this have to do with stuart little ?
how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ?
when the video concludes , the words " to be continued " appear .
oh i ca n't wait to see who they 've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out .
kids wo n't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a " kid at heart " thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them .
this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost .
the di $ ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar .

just how inseparable is the team of sgt .
martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt .
roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ?
let 's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road , flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction , his partner actually does it !
the familiar lethal weapon family is back , including rene russo , who is now the expectant mother of riggs ' child and joe pesci as the soprana-like , foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye .
new to the team is chris rock , also a fast-talking , up and coming detective .
trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go , and in this film , that is no exception .
even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride , they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship .
we here some ominous music , which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen .
gunfire ensues , and when it 's all over , the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord .
although they do n't know what they 're looking for , their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action .
and there 's plenty of action here for two movies .
led by fighting sensation jet li , whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive , he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to .
li is ruthless in his approach , will kill anyone just to make a point , and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives .
there are terrific car chases , explosions and gunshot galore .
it 's a summer action recipe followed to the letter , and the result is nothing less than pure , unadulterated summer fun .
but even too many explosions can get boring .
to counter that , we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li .
luckily , he 'd rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns .
meanwhile , when the detectives are n't reloading their guns or running from fireballs , they 're engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets .
everybody gets in on the shtick .
russo screams during her delivery , the crime lord has a few funny bits when he 's being interrogated while being given laughing gas , and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones .
gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano .
score one for the old guard .

there 's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days .
stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ?
he 's in " there 's something about mary , " which i * still * have n't seen .
and he 's in the acerbic " your friends & neighbors , " playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri .
now there 's " permanent midnight , " in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl .
there 's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they 've proved themselves commercially .
ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in " emma " and " brassed off , " received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle 's transatlantic junk-fest , " trainspotting . "
the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs .
" permanent midnight " is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $ 5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $ 6 , 000-a-week heroin habit .
a habit , in stahl 's own words , " the size of utah . "
as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .
unlike " trainspotting , " which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , " permanent midnight " instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .
one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to " naked lunch " author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , " so i can shave . "
stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in " permanent midnight " ; it 's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .
while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl 's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .
" permanent midnight " shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author 's words-- " escape the drug scene " ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you 'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown 's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time .
janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that 's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .
stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top .
the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see " permanent midnight " ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .

for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and " high art , " the son 's room is an inventive , subtle alternative .
written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement .
slow is the best description for the film at first .
it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family .
father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities .
they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder .
you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome .
but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident .
the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span .
though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving .
though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it does n't come across as a vanity piece .
one might wish he had n't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character 's reactions so predictable .
what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction .
the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss .
you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing .
you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation .
even better are the role reversals that take place within the household .
while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot .
not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she 'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them .
these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change .
respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture .
self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family .
though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives .
most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing .
in contrast , the son 's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters .
it 's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .

it 's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director 's cut of the film .
films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker 's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio .
the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films .
the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson 's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director 's cut .
for years , i have heard of an " international " version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years .
i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors ' cuts - including l ? on .
but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it .
until now .
the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello .
he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops .
one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries .
taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life .
mathilda learns of l ? on 's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on 's footsteps as a " cleaner . "
she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession .
at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in .
the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed " too explicit . "
i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle .
the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda 's and l ? on 's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops .
there 's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson 's la femme nikita , and killing zoe .
with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda 's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version .
the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film .
the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema .
my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece .
director/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello

star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 )
review by matt pusateri
few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas ' 1977 classic , star wars .
the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture .
arguably , more americans today can explain what " the force " or a " jedi " is than a budget deficit or a serb .
so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ?
can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ?
against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week .
and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment .
while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking .
it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films .
the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films .
as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) .
the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation .
the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo 's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) .
later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice .
on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts .
qui-gon senses the child is " unusually strong " with the force and begins to suspect that he may be " the one " prophesized to " bring balance to the force . "
as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader .
complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala .
while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul .
if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is .
the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin 's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy .
but the complexity is not overwhelming .
the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode .
one of the reasons the film 's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused .
it 's unclear whose story phantom menace is .
in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke 's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight .
but it 's unclear whether this new film is anakin 's story or obi-wan 's .
if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it 's a shaky foundation .
lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive .
on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is " the one . "
the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas .
neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight .
mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility .
portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality .
the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them .
individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series .
but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas does n't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another .
in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke .
the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities .
in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other .
there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other .
individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them .
this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers .
but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging .
many of the wonderful elements of lucas ' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining .
first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates .
the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing " destroyers " on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council .
each location is elaborate and complex .
lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines .
most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just were n't possible when the films were made .
more than ever , in this new film , lucas ' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters .
the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves .
watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room .
of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable .
speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks .
with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas ' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy .
jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon 's accidental sidekick .
jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble .
the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors .
however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar is n't completely convincing .
he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene .
throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a " roger rabbit " -like presence .
you accept that he 's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character .
initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film .
on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i did n't mind him at all .
a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates .
despite all the film 's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one 's destiny and " the force , " like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously .
fortunately , lucas has n't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art .
from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film 's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t .
in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed .
and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action .
from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil .
the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed .
the phantom menace wo n't win any major oscars .
it probably wo n't beat titanic 's box office record .
and it 's not even the best star wars film ( i 'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) .
but it 's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster .
the film ca n't live up to it 's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that .
but it 's still worth seeing . . .
probably more than once .

there 's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last .
george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy .
return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films .
the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone .
instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears .
even darth vader does n't seem very intimidating this time around .
with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman .
return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back .
luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke 's home planet of tatooine .
their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt .
it is at jabba 's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play .
from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba 's sand barge , the effects are top notch .
as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it 's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire 's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor .
so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks .
there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader .
return of the jedi has some interesting elements .
the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted .
from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films .
not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved .
on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects .
in the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch .
the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films .
by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas .
the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific .
as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for .
newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he 's not as imposing as vader was in star wars .
although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment .
with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader 's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang .
congratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come .

the premise is simple , if not bizarre .
a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made .
why ?
it 's torturous , it 's maniacal , and it 's just plain fun .
based on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie is n't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely .
mike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies .
the catch is , these movies are n't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike 's will to live .
dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema .
the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man .
we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them .
in this case , it 's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth .
we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary .
the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i 'll explain this one .
this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth .
together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet .
to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it 's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty .
mst3k , which does n't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken .
as funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long .
occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously .
although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it 's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste .
mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you do n't know what you 're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment .
although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year 's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it .
warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most .
the name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience .
most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec 's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .

cinematically speaking , gordon parks ' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film .
a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman 's " black private dick that 's a sex machine to all the chicks " to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking .
yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , " blaxploitation , " died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness .
the reason for this is the same one that explains the film 's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft .
while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass .
this fact also explains why john singleton 's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is .
much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_ 's plot does n't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers .
contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff .
the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972 's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973 's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city .
however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors .
when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i .
but that 's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime .
peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson 's way toward commanding this film .
peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages .
however , he is n't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples ' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) .
it 's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that 's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless .
then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson 's impressive star turn does n't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars .
bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on .
collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane .
busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft 's sidekick rasaan .
registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno .
( jackson also has little to " do " in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft does n't even have one sex scene . )
that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he 's not really an action director .
this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases .
they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it 's just that there 's nothing terribly inventive about them .
these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they 're unsurprising and conventional .
but if there 's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it 's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive .
from the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes ' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado .
even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary .
style does n't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that 's of little consequence .
what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth .

while watching wes anderson 's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film 's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind .
the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman .
schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like " serpico " and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result .
on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore 's baseball field ) in her honour .
unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max 's plans to woo her .
max is one of the best-written characters we 've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age .
as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from " the wonder years " , from a visual standpoint , at least ) .
hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career .
bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we have n't yet seen from him .
while this is n't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here .
williams is n't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work .
rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it is n't a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality .
anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success .

" stuart little " is one of the best family films to come out this year .
it 's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords .
though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint .
finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie .
stuart little is a mouse .
he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles .
a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city .
they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son .
at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat .
george does n't take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond .
stuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are .
the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back .
hesitating the littles know what 's best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart 's past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending .
one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects .
just like in " star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace " stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real .
from the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $ 90 million dollar film and it shows .
another movie that this has in common with is " babe " with it 's talking animals and people understanding them .
it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids .
michael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the " homeward bound " movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could .
he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable .
another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball .
when he was timon in 1994 's " the lion king " i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in " stuart little " he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike .
for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well .
she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little .
both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996 's " jerry maguire " .
even though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other .
" stuart little " is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter .
we get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie .
its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see .
even though it has a $ 90 million dollar budget i 'm sure it will make over that or just below it respectively .
for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know " stuart little " and " toy story 2 " are by far the best family films this year .
a winner . ?

until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie .
forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i 've seen so far this year .
even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there 's a not drop of blood to be seen .
luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton 's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001 .
so , there 's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place .
robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash .
his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $ 10 , 000 somewhere .
powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he 's released and ben is hanged .
but finding the money is n't easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but are n't telling .
the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time .
how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ?
what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ?
( no , i 'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . )
yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter .
powell 's " love " and " hate " knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) .
and powell 's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino 's early visual style .
seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact .
you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club .
he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears .
he 's like the senior class president with an evil streak .
if i ever need to stay awake , i 'll just picture him crooning , " leaning . . .
leaning . . . . "
any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah .
and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop .
it 's a testament to both men that they 're able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we 're more scared by what we do n't see .
screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who 's haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act .
the only lapse is the movie 's third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) .
her showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns .
however , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it 's still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun .
do yourself favor and do n't miss this if it comes to a nearby theater .
note : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie .
the highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters ' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile .
hours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling .
screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) .

that thing you do !
( r ) tom hanks 's screenwriting and directorial debut , that thing you do ! , has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun , lively , and oh-so-nice .
it is the latter quality , however , that becomes a hindrance , for this '60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast .
that thing focuses on the wonders , a teen rock band from erie , pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called , of course , " that thing you do ! "
the group 's members are , naturally a diverse group : there 's brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn ) , the lead guitarist ; a goofy , geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the film 's center , guy ( tom everett scott ) , the drummer who has aspirations in jazz .
along for the wonders ' ride to success is jimmy 's perpetually neglected galpal , faye ( liv tyler ) .
hanks proves to be a capable writer-director , deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964 , which hanks calls " the last innocent year . "
the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music , which , like the other recent period music film , grace of my heart , was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger , which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( it 's still playing in my mind as i write this ) .
it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors , eliciting charming , likable work from the entire cast , most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler , who is remarkable in delivering the film 's biggest and best dramatic moment .
the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early '60s ; they do not appear to be '90s grungers playacting " retro . "
yet for all the light , frothy charms of that thing you do ! , it 's nearly nice to a fault .
while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days , there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting .
everyone is so happy , basking in the glow of overnight success , marvelling at it all--except toward the end , but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness , ending on an appropriately feel-good note .
there is n't much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hanks 's turn as the wonders ' manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice it 's bland .
but a little niceness goes a long way these days , and there 's no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; it 's just about impossible to hate .
it 's an inoffensive , enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming , if not singing , " that thing you do ! " --quite
possibly for days .
to paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play " that thing you do ! "

the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm !
( reviewed at eng wah 's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio )
" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise .
unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited .
unlike fires , there is no way to combat them .
unlike floods , their terror is sudden . "
- excerpt from twister production notes
i 'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before .
i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister .
the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable .
it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . .
basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you 'll get to see all this - close up !
twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers .
these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that
is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !
jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes .
while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo .
apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman .
he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone .
jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement 's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented .
the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function .
to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device .
thus begins the race ; jo 's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas 's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans .
plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about .
twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get .
there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas ^ os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) .
helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself !
thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm 's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock !
jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences .
like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited .
audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen !
the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister !
( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie .
now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et 's ass for the umpteenth time . . . . . . twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent !
watch it in a good theatre . . . please .
the flying inkpot 's rating system : * wait for the video .
* * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !
* * * pretty good , bring a friend .
* * * * amazing , potent stuff .
* * * * * perfection .
see it twice .

synopsis : committed to an asylum , the marquis de sade ( rush ) continues to publish pornographic literature , aided by young maid madeleine ( winslet ) .
abbe coulmier ( phoenix ) , who runs the hospital , disapproves of the stories , but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure .
de sade 's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer-collard ( michael caine ) to stop the marquis ' work , permanently .
review : " quills " is an exploration of the marquis de sade : his madness , his cruelty and his perversion , his obsession with sex in any form , no matter how obscene .
but " quills " also details the marquis ' determination : to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path , and to propagate his words to the masses .
the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie 's most intriguing elements , as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood , or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates , cell to cell .
to provide a contrast with the marquis , wright involves him with two very different characters .
one is the abbe , a handsome , charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god .
the abbe lusts for madeleine , but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her .
and then there is royer-collard , a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis ' motley creations .
rush is splendid as de sade , utterly inhabiting the character .
kaufman 's direction is fine , and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings .
the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly , but this is virtually unimportant .
for two hours , " quills " acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and , more frightening still , allows us brief insight into his scatological soul .

rated : r for strong language , sexual dialogue , drug use , crude humor , violence and brief nudity .
starring : ben affleck , matt damon , linda fiorentino , salma hayek , alan rickman , chris rock , kevin smith , jason mewes , jason lee , george carlin , alanis morissette .
running time : 130 minutes
being a huge fan of kevin smith , i was expecting a lot out of his newest project 'dogma ' .
it might just be kevin 's best work to date .
it 's very funny with smart and foul-mouthed dialogue while unexpectedly it has a serious undertone to it and besides going against god and jesus christ , it actually tries to tell people that there is such a thing rather than that there is n't .
in 1994 a little $ 27 , 000 movie premiered at sundance .
this little film was called 'clerks ' and this little film went on to become a huge video sensation .
you really ca n't meet a person on this green earth who has not seen 'clerks ' .
it was hailed by critics as one of the best movies of the year and soon a sequel is coming .
in 1995 kevin made another movie 'mallrats ' that flopped horribly , thought it was not the best movie ever made it was a pretty good little flick .
it was panned by critics but hailed by audiences and in 1997 'chasing amy ' came out and was kevin 's biggest success to date .
now in 1999 we get a great little movie by the name of 'dogma ' .
wow ! what a cast .
ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic .
one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church .
ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who does n't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) .
now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels .
salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way .
azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win .
bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith .
what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie .
who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself .
now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart .
yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god .
this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie .
kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie .
of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob .
probably the best characters in movies that i like .
the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while .
the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what is n't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think .
chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines .
linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is .
of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) .
alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles .
being oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting ' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could .
ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story .
the movie 's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it .
however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma ' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks ' .
while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but ca n't deny it .
'dogma ' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you .
all kevin smith fans must see ! !
