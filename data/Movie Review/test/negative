even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves .
down periscope stars kelsey " frasier " grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer 's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy .
like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who does n't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on .
then comes the transparent plotline .
first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard .
after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who ca n't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone .
finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise .
and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability .
first they 're singing " louie louie " like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they 're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off .
the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) .
it 's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it .
the jokes are right out of " mchale 's navy " and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past .
there 's one scene where schneider looks through the ship 's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , " this expired in 1966 ! "
i yelled back at the screen , " so did these jokes . "
i watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it .
my mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will .
the blame ca n't really be placed on the stars , though .
kelsey grammer is good in this , he just does n't have anything to work with .
his character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had " welcome aboard " tatooed on his penis .
grammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about .
same for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she 's so gorgeous .
as for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he 's still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the " snl " ship .
my theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( " okay , it 's police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . " ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster .
judging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me .
the only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel 's jim ferguson .
i guess even jeff craig from " 60 second preview " ( who said tank girl " kicks butt ! "
without ever seeing it ) did n't like this .

capsule : where are you tonight , leni rienfenstal ?
starship troopers is an expensive , hateful and unenjoyable piece of violent pornography -- and bad pornography , at that .
it is not good cinema , not good storytelling , and not even stupid fun : it 's so cynically , calculatedly bone-headed that even the least demanding members of the audience i was with were alternately bored and revulsed .
it 's one of the worst movies i 've seen in a long time .
why am i calling this movie pornography ?
pornography , in the abstract , is anything which is calculated to appeal to the baser instincts .
i remember reading a review of full metal jacket which described the climact moment at the end of the movie , where private joker has to shoot the downed vc sniper , as " a near-pornographic eternity " .
i did n't agree with that assessment , but i could see what was being implied : the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout " do 'er , man , do 'er ! "
that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers .
it 's * literally * like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk .
it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening .
the film takes place in our future , when earth has come under attack by some alien species that does n't appear to have intelligence .
to counterattack , humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable : instead of nuke the planet from orbit , which they 're clearly capable of , they send down grunts with m-16 rifles .
this is n't heinlein , it 's a bad wwii movie , one where all the most obvious points of satire are ever poked and prodded in combat scenes that are noisy , repetitive , and ultimately tiresome .
( one scene has a journalist on a battlefield , filimg soldiers being slaughtered , and ends with groaning predictability : said cameraman gets skewered , too . )
the soldiers and their commanders are consistently idiotic .
they do not possess a germ of tactical intelligence or even common sense .
they do n't even behave like soldiers in a bad * movie * , and therefore we do n't care about them .
we hated the tom berenger character in platoon , but he * mattered * , and therefore we were curious to learn about his fate .
here , we do n't even hate the bugs -- what 's there to hate ?
hating them would be like cursing a hurricaine .
if there 's anything really hateful there , the movie does n't know how to give it to us .
the screenwriter ( ed neumeier -- perhaps a better appelation would be " screen typist " ) and director ( the increasingly talent-impaired paul verhoeven ) have not found any way to make the characters or the story serve each other .
one of the subplots concerns a woman pilot who 's great at getting out of tight situations , and does it again and again and again .
once or twice is fine .
by the fifth or sixth time , it 's worn out its welcome .
there 's never any sense that these people are really thinking their way out of anything , or really being tested to show their mettle .
also , the movie is irritatingly selective with how effective the bugs are to earthling weaponry .
if a bug has one of the humans screaming in its grasp , then five guys can stand around it and blast away on full auto without doing a damned thing .
but if one human gets cornered , he lays waste to whole platoons of bugs with one clip .
uh-huh .
the very worst feature of the movie is its repulsive quasi-fascist flavor .
i say " quasi- " because while the movie uses many of the trappings of fascism ot eroticize its action -- the gear , the uniforms , etc . -- the movie does n't have the nerve ( or the brains ) to be genuinely fascist , or intelligent about the subject .
the bumpers between scenes , which are apparently intended to parody wartime recruitment propaganda are propaganda -- just so clumsy and oafish that they wind up making the bugs look relatively innocuous in comparison .
like the rest of the movie .
there 's more , i suppose , but it 's not worth it .
the acting is bland , neither arsenic nor gravy ; the music disposable ; the camerawork turgid .
the heartbreaking thing is that it makes independence day look like a masterpiece .

the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music .
it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi 's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea .
however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged .
unfortunately , it 's a sequel not worthy of the original .
the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended .
elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died .
as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together .
john belushi 's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable .
first , there 's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood 's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) .
cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band .
next , there 's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band .
finally , there 's buster ( j .
evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band .
the plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it
seems to be almost a clone of the original .
elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale .
the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role .
in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original .
remember the classic performance at country bob 's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ?
well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music .
there 's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat .
there 's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) .
there are plenty of recurring characters too .
in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy .
frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden .
as the stars , the new blues brothers do n't live up to their legacy .
aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood .
john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack .
joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab .
and what 's the deal with the orphan ?
it plays like a desperate gimmick that does n't mesh at all with the rest of the film .
at least bonifant is n't as precocious as he could have been in the role .
but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music .
and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) .
although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original 's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable .
to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances .
b . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there .
unfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot .
if simply copying the original blues brothers was n't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks .
it 's a shame .
buy the soundtrack and avoid the film .
better yet , rewatch the original . . . you 'll
have a much better time .

" book " should have remained in shadows
book of shadows : blair witch 2
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman
certain things in our lives are inevitable .
death , sorrow , love , heartbreak , pain , joy .
we expect these events .
we know they 're going to happen and some , we even look forward to .
it 's part of the human condition .
we have also become accustomed to inevitable occurrences in our society .
as we near the fall election , several of them are hitting us in the face .
politicians exaggerate their own importance .
our side is always right ; theirs is always wrong .
in the end , voters are usually forced to choose the lesser of two whocares .
in hollywood the one indisputable inevitable is that if a film makes big money , there will be a sequel .
even if the original story does n't merit one .
even if the first film is complete in itself .
even if success is a fluke .
" the blair witch project " was made with a budget of $ 1 . 75 and exploded on the screen , raking in huge profits .
the concept was brilliant .
the filmmakers created a remarkable buzz that the story might be real .
the film itself was even more convincing .
the movie _must_ be authentic .
why else would such amateurish footage be on the big screen ?
the first film caught lightning in a bottle .
the sequel proves you ca n't pour that old lightning into a new bottle .
you have to give this effort some credit .
it would have been easy to have made the same movie again with a new group of kids .
it would have been easy , but of course , it would n't have worked .
instead " book of shadows " acknowledges the first film as a movie and concentrates on the hysteria following its release .
it 's a great scheme and possibly the only entertaining way to do a sequel .
unfortunately it does n't work either .
five kids spend the night in the woods at the scene of the first film .
weird stuff happens and they retreat to an old factory where one of them lives .
even weirder stuff happens .
some people die , there 's blood and knives and none of the characters have a lick of common sense .
while supposedly doing serious research , the group sets up a circle of surveillance cameras in the ruins of the old house in the woods and vows to stay alert all night awaiting a visitation .
then they proceed to get totally trashed on drugs and alcohol and party down with very loud , very obnoxious heavy metal music .
it 's a bad plan .
the cast shows some early promise .
a couple is doing research on a " blair witch " book .
the tour guide is a former mental patient turned ebay aficionado .
a goth amazon princess adds a bit of comedic relief .
the obligatory hot babe is the 2000 spiritual cinematic descendent of the cute hippie chick , the cute rock and roll chick and the cute disco chick : the cute wiccan chick .
the first film 's unaccomplished actors came across as real people in a real situation because hours and hours of video were shot during days in the woods .
this time , these unaccomplished actors just come across as unaccomplished actors .
there 's not one character you care about when they start shouting for no reason .
although what passes for a plot starts out with a solid idea , it 's ruined by poor execution .
the follow-up to one of the most successful horror films ever is nothing more than a bad slasher movie .
they 're trapped in an old big weird house .
they stupidly separate into various rooms .
there are strange noises , they see scary apparitions and people disappear .
ever see this movie ?
seasoned documentary director joe berlinger should know better .
the film features mostly cheap tricks and unnecessary gore .
for a storyline filled with surprises , it 's oddly predicable .
" the blair witch project " was a rare triumph of style over substance .
" the book of shadows " is a triumph of tedium over promise .

the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing .
however , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel .
and , considering the quality of species 2 , it 's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead .
the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is .
if you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience .
of course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , should n't be able to get into an " r " -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies .
there 's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring .
this is a grade z exploitation flick that 's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment .
somewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as " erotic . "
i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism .
sure , there 's a lot of sex and nudity , but it 's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman 's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions .
anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater .
i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) .
although the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone .
this creature , dubbed " eve " by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile .
meanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars .
a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them .
ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he 's soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session .
his intention is obviously world domination .
standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick 's fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) .
but when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there 's no damping his ardor .
i 'm not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) .
michael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run .
ditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick 's father -- " underused " is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( " invisible " would be more like it ) .
george dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general .
meanwhile , justin lazard 's performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge 's limited abilities look good by comparison .
the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick .
complete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics .
director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness .
do i recommend the movie ?
absolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it did n't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do .
here 's hoping there 's no species 3 .

the previews for the movie are pretty good .
they show a little plot , all the characters , and the emotional highlights , all spliced together to give a general impression of the script .
unfortunately , the full movie adds nothing but 115 minutes .
the residents of mystery love hockey .
mystery and hockey go together like texas and high school football .
the townsfolk love hockey so much that they even acquit a player who 's guilty of shooting another man ( yes , that 's one of the movie 's jokes . )
every saturday , the best players pair off for a game , and the whole town comes to watch .
the town 's prodigal son charlie ( hank azaria ) wrote an article on the weekly game for sports illustrated .
mystery 's national fame has the town abuzz .
a week later , charlie actually shows up in person , and he brings with him an offer from the nhl .
the new york rangers will come to mystery to play the locals .
the mysterians see this as both good and bad .
on the one hand , they 'd love to have the fame and the money of such an exhibition .
on the other hand , they do n't want to turn up as the butt of leno and letterman jokes .
the movie follows a handful of lives that are affected by the proposition .
biebe ( russell crowe ) has just been retired from the team and is asked to coach the boys , including his new replacement .
he 's already resentful , and to top it off charlie has been making eyes at his wife .
crowe is not given a lot of room to act in this film , so he 's just kind of stuck with constantly brooding .
charlie , meanwhile , is resentful of having born in a town where hockey is the only measure of a man 's worth .
his " gift " of the feature story , and of the new york rangers , was his way of compensating for not being a better skater .
he hoped it would earn him some respect and merit , but the townspeople find reasons to continue disliking him .
burt reynolds could have been interesting as walter , the judge whose courtroom was befouled by a moronic jury of hockey fans .
walter actually has some experience with collegiate hockey , but he actively tries to put it behind him .
he wants his son to take the game more seriously , but he wants his community to just get over it .
reynolds could have been good , but sloppy writing and/or editing keep walter in the corner , and so reynolds never really gets to pull his performance all together .
one character actually was interesting .
biebe 's wife ( mary mccormack ) , like the judge , understood that there was more to life than hockey .
but unlike him she has come to accept the skewed view of the community .
she chose the town and her husband with her eyes wide open .
her unique insight is verbalized once , and it lasts only a scene before it is gone , but her performance carries the hint of some deeper wisdom .
mysterty , alaska follows a handful of other characters , but none are well developed or worth mentioning .
the biggest problem with this movie is that there is no real heart to the story , no underlying thing that the movie is really about .
instead , roach and screenwriters david e . kelley and sean o'byrne try to cram the entire human condition into this sports comedy .
they try to make you laugh and cry , to feel outrage and pride .
they present the framing and cadence for jokes , but there 's nothing truly funny .
they show appropriately staged scenes of sadness , but they give you nothing to be really sad about .
as columnist molly ivins would say , it 's all hat , no cattle .
the perfect opportunity arises for roach to say what this movie is really about .
there is a funeral scene , played with appropriate gravity and somber music .
it is a chance for the characters to reflect on their lives and decide what 's truly important .
russell crowe steps forward to speak , about to spell out the movie 's metaphor for us .
he says that what really matters in life is " community . . . . "
then adds " and hockey . "
i guess these mysterians really are as shallow as they appear .
only mildly bad , mystery , alaska probably deserves 2 stars .
i even laughed out loud , genuine laughs in places .
but i docked it an extra half star when mike myers , a friend of roach , turned up in a role that did n't suit him .
myers is a comic character actor .
he puts on masks , becomes an outrageous caricature , and is funny .
he 's great as austin powers , dr . evil , or any of his scottish characters .
nobody else in mysterty , alaska is a comic caricature .
all the other people have the feel of dramatic characters in semi-serious roles .
for roach to bring in myers for a few cheap laughs shows incredible contempt toward the rest of his cast , toward his audience , and indeed toward the film itself .
it 's an acknowledgment by the director that the film is not worth taking seriously .

darren ( jason biggs ) , wayne ( steve zahn ) , and j . d . ( jack black ) have been best friends since the fifth grade .
like the three musketeers , they 've been together through thick and thin .
but , when darren meets an attractive , but cold-blooded and manipulative , psychiatrist , judith ( amanda peet ) , the long time friendship is placed in danger .
it 's up to wayne and j . d . to rescue their best friend in " saving silverman . "
" silverman " has its heart in the right place , but the story , by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul , is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren 's soul .
based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake , the story is centered on the three , life long amigos .
when wayne introduces darren to judith , he does n't realize that he has opened a pandora 's box of disaster for himself and j . d . judith was once in a relationship where her boyfriend was the dominant figure until he died in a kick boxing match .
since then , she has sought a new mate - someone she can boss around and mold into her own vision .
enter darren silverman .
once they realize the magnitude of their error in judgement , wayne and j . d . try everything they can , including threats and bribery , to get judith to free darren .
nothing works until the duo come up with a plan - kidnap judith and get darren back together with the girl he called his one and only , pretty sandy perkus ( amanda detmer ) .
the only problem here is that sandy is about to take her vows to become a nun .
things spiral out of control as judith repeatedly attempts to escape while wayne and j . d . play cupid .
the boys even bring their idol , neil diamond , into the picture to help resolve things .
thinking about it , this is a real mishmash of contrivance and coincidence that is held together solely by the comedic efforts of steve zahn and jack black .
the pair is able to elicit the film 's only laughs with their goofy antics and child-like behavior .
they are relegated to providing slapstick guy humor and the two are more than equal to the task .
steve zahn has been steadily honing his comedic acting skills and gives some complexity to wayne , the " brains " of the gang .
jack black has the big-guy moves of a chris farley , giving j . d . an amusing physical presence .
the neat thing is that the two actors are able to get fresh laughs from stale material .
the rest of the cast does n't fare as well , though .
jason biggs is the straight man of the musketeers and gets very little to do ; though having watched his previous films ( " american pie " and " loser " ) i 'm not sure what attraction biggs actually has .
amanda peet is caustic as the manipulative judith .
there is no humanity at all to her character as she single-mindedly strives to recreate darren into her mind 's image .
she 's a monster that wayne and j . d . must defeat to save their friend .
unfortunately , there is no dimension to her character .
amanda detmer brings nothing ( or gets nothing ) as darren 's one and only .
r . lee ermey , as the psychotic coach , made a bad decision taking this role .
tune-meister neil diamond gives a good-natured cameo perf as the boys ' idol and savior .
production values are on par with the rest of the film - lackluster and non-involving .
director dennis dugan has a track record for broad comedy with films like " big daddy " and " beverly hills ninja , " but falls flat with " saving silverman . "
the 2001 movie year has yet to provide us with a " good " film to sink our teeth into .
at least , with " saving silverman , " we get a couple of funny perfs from zahn and black .
too bad that the rest of the film lacks their level of humor .
kick boxing deaths and conflicted nuns are not the makings of a good comedy .
i give it a c- .

how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ?
in spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it .
if that was their goal , they did a fantastic job .
so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it was n't really meant to be much better than this ?
honestly , i 'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades , so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ?
truth be known , i do n't really think i can answer this question .
to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls .
unless you 're very * very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them .
they 're a group of five busty british babes who 've had # 1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions .
they 're primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice 's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra .
all five of the girls have these " spicy " names for which they are better known than their real names .
there is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c . ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b . ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names .
the spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame .
it 's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves .
they do n't take themselves too seriously , and that 's probably the best thing about them .
it 's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing .
they 're not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves ) .
what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls wo n't get enough of their music , while the rest of us do n't get enough of a movie .
the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes .
most of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud !
if you 're a big fan of the group , you probably wo n't get enough of what you want , and if you 're not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than " look at us " moments .
for the right crowd , the " music video " sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline .
other key actors include richard e . grant as clifford , the spice girls ' manager , alan cumming as the film-maker piers cutherton-smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group , george wendt as martin barnfield , a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie , and roger moore in a small , self-parodizing role .
all provide relatively good performances , keeping in mind once again that this film was n't meant to be acted seriously .
even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it .
while this film is continuously compared to the beatles ' a hard day 's night , i think that is an unjust comparison .
it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits , but i do n't think drector bob spiers , nor the spice girls , intended it to be so .
i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film , and have instead , come off rather pretentious .
i do n't think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun , satirical look at a group that got so big , a movie seemed the next likely step .
and what could 've been better than a self-indulged yet self- mocking approach ?
probably nothing , and so it is .
spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy , but now instead , i find myself wanting to defend a movie i did n't even give a good review .
it 's bad , but it succeeds in every way it intended .
it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment .
perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick .
if that 's the case , the movie 's gimmick is that it * is * such a gimmick !
you might be saying , " a spice girls movie ?
come on ! " , but when it comes down to it , i think that 's the point .

sean connery stars as a harvard law professor who heads back into the courtroom , by way of the everglades , to defend a young , educated black man ( blair underwood ) .
the guy is on death row for the murder of a white girl , and says that his confession was coerced from the region 's tough , black cop ( lawrence fishburne ) .
watching connery and fishburne bump heads for two hours is amusing enough , but the plot 's a joke .
there 's no logic at work here .
tone is also an issue--there is none .
director arne glimcher never establishes exactly what his film is trying to say .
is it a statement on human rights ?
is it a knock-off of silence of the lambs ?
glimcher never tells .
instead , he forces his characters to jump through hoop after hoop , over drawbridge after drawbridge , hoping that the audience wo n't notice what 's missing .
just awful .

still wondering who nigel hawthorne is ?
then check out his oscar- nominated work in the madness of king george , still playing in both raleigh and chapel hill .
stage director nicholas hytner , in a remarkable screen debut , has adapted alan bennett 's 1991 tragic comedy to fine effect .
sumptuous-looking and only mildly stuffy , the film charts the madness that plagued king george iii ( hawthorne ) almost 30 years into his reign .

in suri krishnamma 's a man of no importance , albert finney disappears so deeply into the role of a lovable dublin bus conductor that it 's a shame when the film gets so serious around him .
his character is a conductor with a passion for oscar wilde .
he reads to his riders , and once a year , with their help , he tries to stage one of the author 's plays .
this year it 's " salome . "
for about an hour , there 's a sweet magic behind finney and his troupe of working-class stiffs .
conflict arises , but it 's small stuff--an administrator from the bus company here , an outraged catholic pork butcher ( michael gambon ) there .
but with finney at the wheel , so to speak , the film rolls smoothly over these plot points--just like the gorgeous leland double-decker bus in the story .
where things get serious is toward the end of the film , when the plot takes a turn that the bus never would , and the story heads down a very dark alley that marks the end of an enjoyable ride .
the twist makes sense--and helps paint a complete picture of finney 's character--but the trip to get there betrays the light , airy atmosphere of what had come before .
it 's not a fatal misstep , mind you , and it does n't send the story soaring into the realms of incredulity .
it 's just a turn off .

the most fun that * i * had last month was in durham , at the carolina , at a mid-week screening of stanley kubrick 's pitch-black comedy dr .
strangelove ( or how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb ) .
the 1964 film stars peter sellers ( in three roles ) , george c . scott , sterling hayden , and slim pickens .
their antics brought the house down , which , to my surprise , was packed by an audience younger than the film .

play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton 's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .
like most of shelton 's other great films ( bull durham , white men ca n't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .
shelton 's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .
shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .
play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .
the film has no social message like its predecessors .
the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .
the whole film , since it is primarily a " buddy picture , " depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .
unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .
1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .
the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .
2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .
there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .
3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .
she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other .
4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .
vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .
these boring tales only hurt the central plot .
5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they do n't even hesitate to pound each other .
was n't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ?
by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over .
shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .
forty five painful minutes remain .
the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .
however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .

maybe this mission should have been scrubbed
mission to mars
a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman
there 's a world of difference between artists and technicians .
the artist has a vision to create something new .
he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it 's something you 've never seen before .
a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it 's going to be just a xerox .
obviously successful films need both skills .
brian de palma is a masterful technician .
he 's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock .
he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote .
aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead .
in de palma 's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick .
to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called " 2001 " .
i enjoyed it even more when it was titled " close encounters " .
nasa has set its sights for mars .
when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet .
they do n't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe .
and it 's all so boring .
there are so many scenes that just do n't work , it 's difficult to begin .
when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from " dune " ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching .
error .
the most interesting character ( and that 's not saying much ) is killed off .
error .
the alien is laughable .
error .
the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable .
error .
there 's some nice eyecandy .
the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool .
a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world .
maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic .
but there 's so much more that feels as if we 've been there before .
from " 2001 " , there 's the rotating space station , the blinding white room .
> from " close encounters " , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens .
the list goes on .
the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues .
even gary sinise and tim robbins ca n't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing .
no one seems to care about anything that happens .
you wo n't either .
the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day .
they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .

bats is this year 's camp flick .
with the world 's worst dialogue , cheesiest premise and stupidest editor , this one should be heaven for those who enjoy films humorous in their inanity .
as for the rest of us , well . . .
i 'd say skip it , but looking at the box office figures for this one , it seems as though most of america is following that advice anyway .
follow their lead and you 'll spare yourself 90 minutes of your life and 8 bucks to boot .
i love alfred hitchcock 's the birds , almost as much as i love the short story on which it is based .
it saddens me even more , then , to see that american treasure ripped off so blatantly by wannabe horror/schlock such as bats .
when mysterious bat attacks occur in a small texas town , the authorities call in a batologist ( dina meyer ) to investigate .
it turns out that a creepy scientist ( bob gunton ) has genetically enhanced a couple bats that escaped from his lab , making them smarter and more vicious .
why has he done this , you ask ?
because , you see , it is apparently a scientist 's job to make things " a little better , " even if that means the death of all mankind .
so the batologist , her wisecracking sidekick and the town sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) have to kill all the bats and save the world .
of course , that ca n't happen before they wallow in some guamo ( bat shit , for the uninitiated ) , get up close and personal with some truly repulsive flying mammals and survive some of the dumbest situations ever seen in a professionally produced motion picture .
consider , for example , a scene where two people are in a bat cave .
the bats are all sleeping , but the humans are afraid they might wake up before they can get out .
what do they do ?
do they get the hell out of there as fast as they can ?
nope .
they stand there for a while , transfixed by the thousands of bats opening their eyes .
what keeps bats from being scary or creepy is the hyperactive editing in most of the attack scenes .
we do n't even get to see what 's going on ; the screen becomes a mush because the cuts are so quick .
all we know is that bats are attacking .
how they are attacking and what exactly is happening remains a mystery .
a little technical proficiency does wonders for horror movies , and bats sure could use some .
of course , director louis morneau tries to liven things up with some intentional humor , but it is so conventional it does n't really go anywhere .
most of the ocmic relief comes courtesy of the batologist 's wisecracking sidekick ( leon ) , who takes every opportunity to sputter ingenious lines like " i hate bats ! "
some of these are so bad that they take on a double quality : they may inspire a smirk by their very nature and a roaring laugh because they are so inept .
i hate characters who exist for the sole purpose of spouting lame one-liners .
playing such characters does not help actors ' careers .
still , i suppose that if you 're looking for a movie that is " so bad it 's good , " you could do worse than bats .
it does have a tremendous amount of camp value .
i 'm not " recommending " the movie because , quite frankly , it sucks , and i know that this might convince some people to go out and see it .
more power to them .

alexander dumas ' the three musketeers is one of the most often-adapted literary works , and for good reason : the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story .
perhaps the musketeer , a new film that " reimagines " the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix , is one adaptation too many .
it 's just awful : spiritless , silly and unforgivably boring , transforming the timeless classic into a mish-mash of old-as-time clich ? s and incoherent , repetitive action sequences .
this time , d'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers , who ca n't even pronounce his character 's name .
as a boy , he watched his father get killed by febre ( tim roth ) , a lackey of power-hungry cardinal richelieu .
he vowed to have vengeance .
after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman , he goes looking for his enemy .
on his quest , he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government .
the royal musketeers have lost their gusto , what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal 's own guards .
only a few loyal swashbuckers remain , among them athos and portos ( who are only figureheads in this movie ) .
together with d'artagnan , they fight to extricate the queen ( catherine deneuve ) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant .
oh , and as an afterthought , d'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn ( mena suvari ) .
just thought i 'd mention that .
now , look : i do n't know whose idea this was , but whoever is responsible deserves a severe tongue-lashing .
i have nothing against " modernizing " classic works of literature - at the very least , they can inspire viewers to actually read the book - but films as dull as this have no positive side effects .
director peter hyams , known for such masterpieces of modern cinema as timecop and end of days , has jettisoned everything that was great about dumas ' masterwork : the sense of excitement , cause , and camaraderie .
instead , we get impressively choreographed but somehow vacuous , uninvolving action sequences that emerge from emptiness and lead to nothing .
when the musketeers finally get to holler " all for one , and one for all , " i could have sworn that was dumas rolling in his grave that i felt .
maybe the reason for the utter lack of suspense here is the hyams 's tone , which is unreasonably dark and brooding when you consider the reader 's digest condensed version of the story that he gives us .
it 's as though anything that may have been construed as " fun " was purposely expunged from the production .
the joylessness of the proceedings , from the oppressively shady lighting to the mechanical fight scenes , can be felt in every frame .
chambers ca n't act ; suvari , roth and deneuve can , but are n't given the chance .
and when push comes to shove , the use of stunt doubles is distractingly obvious , though at least roth gets to play a villain without having to wear an ape suit .
some movies seem sloppy and careless , clearly made for a quick buck .
with the musketeer we get the sense that it was meticulously crafted to be awful .
the film is intricate , stylish and precise , hitting the wrong note every single time .

although i had not been a viewer of the " rugrats " television series , i went into their first animated feature film , " the rugrats movie , " with a positive attitude .
the trailer looked cute enough , after all .
after seeing it , i think the words in my recent " antz " review , in which i stated that it was the worst film of its type since 1995 's " the pebble and the penguin , " were a bit premature .
" the rugrats movie , " is bottom-of-the-barrel children 's fare at its worst , and starts to make , " antz " look good in comparison .
as in the show , " the rugrats movie , " is about a group of very little friends , ranging from babies to a three-year-old .
the head of the group , tommy pickles ( e . g .
daily ) , becomes distraught when his mother has a newborn baby named dill ( get it ?
dill pickles ? . . . hardee-har-har ! ) and is informed by his three-year-old cousin , anjelica ( cheryl chase ) , that the new babies always take all of the attention away from the other children .
when the other children , chuckie , and twins lil and phil , suggest taking dill back to the hospital , tommy goes along with it , but on their way there , they crash in the forest , and become lost , running into wolves and circus monkeys , among other things .
" the rugrats movie , " judging from the idea of being lost in the woods , could have been a potentially fun family film , and there were many different things that could have been done with the story .
so what did the writers choose to do ?
why , they set up a protracted , cliched scene where the children almost go over a waterfall , of course !
for the youngest of children ( ages 3-7 ) , " the rugrats movie , " may very well entertain them , judging from the audience i saw this with .
of course , if you looked around at all of the older kids and their parents , they were all desperately struggling to stay awake , and that included me .
for an adult , " the rugrats movie , " is a piece of garbage .
the plotline is unoriginal and the writing has absolutely no wit or charm .
there is n't one laugh to be had in the film , nor is there any excitement .
if anything is even marginally good in the picture , it is the bright animation style , so it is especially unfortunate that it was n't to service a more quality film .
" the rugrats movie " is doa from the start .
i am all for a worthwhile family movie , but sometimes an animated film comes along that is simply awful .
as said before , young children may like it , but even they deserve better than this .
for adults , it is a nearly unbearable , excruciating chore to sit through .
as for me , " the rugrats movie , " is not the worst of the year , nor is it the most deeply hated , but it is the most boring .
parents : do yourselves a favor and take your kids to see the rerelease of , " the wizard of oz . "
that is a picture that contains a great deal of magic and wonder , two things of which , " the rugrats movie , " is completely missing .

out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller .
though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it 's not nearly good enough .
in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery .
he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny .
he does n't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine .
valentine was jenny 's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive .
he 's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee 's gold in 1997 .
seeking valentine 's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson .
he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party .
he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine 's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it .
what a mess .
i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer .
the limey does exactly that .
the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose .
there is no method to this movie 's madness .
it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably .
the plot is n't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving .
this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist does n't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude .
i felt like the director was n't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck .
ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant .
sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal .
he 's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here .
peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he 's shy , quiet but always effective .
he 's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings do n't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are .
this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion .
why soderbergh could n't just parrot down and tell a story , i do n't know , but what he does do certainly does n't work .
the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes do n't work .
1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it .
shall we go back to basics ?

the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it 's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year 's finest films .
so , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled .
it is a rare thing for a children 's movie to be praised this highly , so would n't you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly " magical " piece of work ?
a tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film .
looking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater .
believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city .
the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon .
but after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially .
the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) .
problem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded " city " , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion .
setting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you can not keep them in hotels .
it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright .
here is where the film took a wrong turn .
up until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience .
the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs .
unfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe .
the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is .
at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown .
at other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget 's full cavity search at the airport .
in fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing .
however , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway .
the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child .
another problem i found with the film was it 's sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story .
if you 're going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine .
it may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition .
but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ?
it just did n't feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie .

" we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . "
starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung
taiwan , 24/12/99 .
the millenium approaches .
an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city .
sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus .
the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners .
the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week 's time .
residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap .
this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas .
the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that .
the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background .
instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities .
the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible .
it 's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background .
the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman 's .
one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man 's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman 's living room .
this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character 's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways .
example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole .
the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up .
this is what passes for meaningful communication .
and they say romance is dead .
much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are .
there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people .
they are ciphers .
instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles .
( this is as fascinating as it sounds . )
offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i 'm told , in 1950s ' china ) .
she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights .
sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man .
these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail .
when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless .
astaire and rogers this is not .
even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring .
the hole is part of the 'collection 2000 ' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium .
others include canada 's last night , brazil 's midnight , and american hal hartley 's the book of life .
the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry .
witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty .
american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions .
foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art .
the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters ' alienation .
if so , he succeeds .
perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we do n't .
if it was a challenge , i was n't up for it .

your first clue that something is n't gon na be quite right with the movie you 're about to see : it 's heavily christmas-themed and its release date is , oh , say , at the end of february .
your second clue that something is n't gon na be quite right with the movie you 're about to see : charlize theron , one of the movie 's dubious stars , makes an appearance on the daily show in which , when asked if her new movie 's any good , she replies with the equivalent of a verbal sigh . . .
assuring us that , yeah , it sure is a movie , all right !
and there 's some scenes like those you 'd expect to find in a movie , and there 's some action . . .
and there 's other . . .
stuff . . .
too .
how to immediately grab my attention : open your movie with five dead guys in santa claus suits .
then show a caption reading " six days earlier . . . "
ya know , i was honestly interested to find out what killed all those poor santas . . .
how to immediately lose my attention : follow your opening scene with a terminally dull nice-guys-who-do n't-deserve-to-be-in-prison scene .
write a line for the one of prisoners like " i just want to go home and eat christmas dinner and watch some ball with my dad . "
then , have ben affleck actually say that line , on film , and forget to leave it on the cutting room floor .
for good measure , throw in a poorly motivated prison riot and have affleck 's best buddy stabbed . . .
aw . . .
and just two days before his release , too .
already the cliches are piled on thick , and when it rains , it pours .
how to take my attention , dash it violently against the rocks , and make it so that i 'm contemplating my strategy for calling " shotgun " about an hour before i know the credits will roll : deny your characters the ability to think .
have ben affleck , for some reason i 'll never understand , pretend he 's his dead prison buddy so that he can get his girlfriend , played by charlize theron .
have gary sinise show up and force the two of them to participate in a poorly planned casino heist .
the villains ' big idea ?
kidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some " diversions " and rob the place .
on paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he 's looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller .
it 's not like the man is n't capable . . .
far from it .
he 's the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may .
he wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i 've ever seen in last year 's ronin .
but he 's certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . .
put reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr . moreau .
step one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world 's most generic hero .
he gets no good one-liners , he does n't get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie .
his name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood .
see , it 's called reindeer games .
get it ?
get it ?
shut up . )
in the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man .
step two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise 's villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with .
he 's dirty and potty-mouthed , he 's got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them .
he 's also extremely inept at what he does .
he thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck 's character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him .
but instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he 's playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script .
[ on a side note , gary sinise wins this week 's " title ! "
award , as he 's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings .
last week 's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ]
how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely .
this is a bad movie .
and what 's worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad .
if they 'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained .

wolfgang petersen 's latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple .
it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it 's going to hurt ? quite a bit .
ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here 's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there is n't really much of a story to tell .
basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of " the storm of the century . "
how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ?
not nearly enough .
so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous .
audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel .
the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters .
i have yet to read sebastian junger 's the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale .
based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak .
using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality .
right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who 's always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) .
so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer .
it is not the all-star cast 's fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal .
allen payne 's character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he 's never given any lines !
are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ?
fichtner 's character is terribly underdeveloped - we do n't know what he 's doing there , where he 's from , or who he 's supposed to be .
the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene " you know what would look good on you ?
me ! "
ooooh real creative ) .
as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human .
only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk .
the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real .
i can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again .
this is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film .
the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment .
the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so .
i guess i 'll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ?

capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .
visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver 's travels and treat it as an action film .
that makes it a film without much center .
, 0 ( -4 to + 4 )
pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .
it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver 's travels .
humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift 's island of the houyhnhnms .
the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .
it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that .
when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish .
the final irony of the original version has become film history .
without it there could never have been a " planet of the apes " film series .
i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .
in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .
that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .
serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .
justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .
but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .
few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .
partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith 's best if not his best .
when the film 's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .
while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .
the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .
now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .
for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton 's new version is even less faithful .
first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .
he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .
that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .
as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .
in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world 's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .
then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .
( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )
he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .
and the language they talk is earth- english .
apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .
the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently did n't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .
both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .
in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .
outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .
leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .
ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .
she is bent on making the world a better place .
perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .
in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .
she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .
it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .
this is a further abandonment of the source material .
the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each 's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .
we can not see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .
we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .
burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .
this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .
they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .
the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like " i never met an ape i did n't like , " but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .
most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .
the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .
this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .
in general it seems much improved from 1968 .
the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .
in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .
it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .
chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .
today audiences have higher expectations ; baker 's visualization is really an improvement .
these visuals work nicely .
what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .
they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .
apes spring incredible distances .
some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .
one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .
since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .
the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .
it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .
but he delivers them very well .
he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .
as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .
in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .
he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov 's performance in spartacus .
as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .
danny elfman 's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith 's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .
that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .
i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece .
some of them are n't even good .
some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful " un indien dans la ville " ( presented as " little indian , big city , " and remade into that crap tim allen flick , " jungle2jungle " ) , and this .
what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick .
" french twist " ( the " cool " american title , not the real one , which was " gazon maudit , " literally meaning " twisted ground , " or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them .
loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married .
always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out .
and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off .
so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo .
but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she 's also realizes she 's still in love with alain chabat .
so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both .
she 'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she 'll rest by herself .
after all , she needs it if she 's gon na have more sex than sylvia kristel .
the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there 's the little ironic ( ! ! ! )
ending .
i know it 's a completely different culture , and i 'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad .
none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in " fargo " ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience .
what 's shocking is this was not only one of france 's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) .
the writing and directing is really the big problem with it .
josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy is n't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all .
even woody allen 's not-very-good " a midsummer night 's sex comedy " is intelligent , well-written , and possesses some depth .
this is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch .
the film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn-near painful to watch .
thank god for the fast forward button .
the acting , however , is n't bad at all .
the actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she 's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) .
and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband .
but " french twist " is just pretty lame .
it 's not overly horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments .
but it 's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film .

she was the femme in " la femme nikita . "
he was the baldwin in " backdraft , " " sliver , " and " fair game " ( with cindy crawford ) .
together , anne parillaud and william baldwin conspire to make " shattered image " the biggest piece of hooey since the stallone/stone " thriller " " the specialist . "
the film poses the question " what if the life you 're living now is really a dream , and your dreams reality ? "
it 's either about a woman who 's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she 's a hired assassin , or it 's about a hired assassin who 's haunted by a recurring ( and recurring and recurring ) nightmare that she 's honeymooning with william baldwin in jamaica .
it does n't much matter and believe me by the time " shattered image " runs its painful and pedestrian course you wo n't care .
these two lives , with parillaud looking like siouxsie sioux with a black wig , black emotionless eyes , and black leather clothing in the seattle-based assassin scenes , and moping around like karen carpenter in the jamaica scenes , play out endlessly throughout the film and the result is it 's now * twice * as boring as it might have been .
it 's not that complicated plots ca n't be entertaining .
of course it helps if you have interesting characters , crisp dialogue , and a modicum of style .
" shattered image " is n't complex , it 's just stupid .
and boring .
parillaud and baldwin , who are n't exactly shakespearean material to begin with , are saddled with such leaden dialogue that their characters have zero chance of breaking free of their cardboard confines .
lines like :
" you do n't beg , you insist .
i like that in a woman . "
that 's parillaud 's character talking . . .
to her cat !
and :
" you 're not the reason i could n't care less about you . "
huh ?
and this wonderful bathroom interchange early in the film :
" if you give me a couple of minutes you know i 'll charm the pants off you . "
" i do n't have that kind of time . "
talking of pants , parillaud has her clothes off faster than you can say " point of no return . "
we have come to expect this from billy baldwin , but it might have been nice to have learned something about their characters first .
but there 's nothing to learn .
karen is as interesting as a cereal box , a someone 's-out-to-get-me crybaby who imagines the voice at the other end of the phone , the stranger who sends her flowers , maybe even her husband himself , is her would-be killer .
siouxsie is the chromium cool , tough-as-nails crack killing machine who shoots out a couple of mirrors in order to justify the film 's meaningless stock title .
baldwin seems more interested in parillaud 's nest egg ( so that he can pave paradise and put up a parking lot ) than he does in her .
each time graham greene shows up he gets killed .
barbet schroeder ( " reversal of fortune " ) co-produced and should be ashamed of himself .
every now and again it 's fun to watch a really bad movie .
and every now and again , as " shattered image " makes agonizingly clear , it is n't .

written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni
directed by terry gilliam
i 've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid .
dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last .
then there 's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose .
mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing .
acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy .
my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie .
full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson 's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out .
but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag .
fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed " gonzo " journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney 's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 .
operating under the pseudonyms of " raoul duke " and " dr .
gonzo " , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers .
they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them .
duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge .
dr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane 's " white rabbit " reaches its climax .
and these guys do n't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead .
that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view .
thompson 's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document .
it simultaneously exposed the 60 's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die .
pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson 's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy .
it 's a cheech and chong movie .
you 're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down .
there 's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard .
this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes .
there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen .
but to what end ?
much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson 's book , and there are some priceless comic observations .
but you 're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work .
this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong .
depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson 's dialogue .
in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost .
watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see .
it 's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over .
as much of a fan as i am of gilliam 's work , cox would have been the better choice .
sid and nancy , cox 's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film .
gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose .
what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ?
it does n't try to be a cautionary tale , and it does n't work as broad comedy .
if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film .
but i do n't want to be too hard on it .
there are some truly funny moments , and if you 're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it .
i do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect .

the " disney stick-to-what-you-do-best " rule states that disney 's animated features will invariably be sublime but whenever they try their hand at live-action kids ' entertainment , they will fail miserably .
this goes double for occasions when they try to make a live-action adaptation of a popular cartoon ( remember the 1996 version of 101 dalmations ?
i 'm still trying to forget ) .
that rule proves more dependable than ever with inspector gadget , an insulting , despicable and , worst of all , expensive piece of trash trying to pass itself off as a viable children 's film .
it will bore anyone over five and should prove unbearable for adults , even at its relatively skinny running time of 80 minutes .
it 's films like this that make me want to go to my local blockbuster and rent something from the days when brains were more important than budgets and wit compensated for lack of fancy effects .
just as matthew broderick began to convince me that there is hope for him as an actor yet , his career takes a nosedive to hell with his " role " as john brown , a depressed security guard with a big heart who hopes that one day he can become a real policemen and help the people around him .
he dreams of heroic deeds and the subsequent admiration of his long time crush , dr . brenda bradford ( joely fisher ) .
but after a few bizarre coincidences it seems that he has to dream no longer .
john breaks every bone in his body while trying to save dr . brenda 's father .
dr . brenda has been working on a " gadget project , " which would make a half-man half-machine super-policeman to fight crime .
feeling indebted to john she decides to save his life by making him the subject , realizing his dream of becoming a policeman .
now , when he says " go go gadget [ insert name of gizmo here ] " he can use all kinds of nifty gadgets to capture crooks , bang up bandits and mangle murderers .
in the meantime , the evil claw ( rupert everett ) , the man responsible for the murder of the good doctor 's father is building a gadget of his own : a carbon copy of our inspector gadget except evil and john brown 's worst nemesis .
claw has plans of world domination , which leaves it up to the inspector and his gadget mobile ( voice of d . l .
hughley ) to save humanity from his wrath .
state of the art effects fly at a mad pace in this $ 90 million dollar movie and yet director david kelogg never sets up a convincing atmosphere .
had they replaced all the fancy gizmos with dollar bills they would have wound up with the same effect .
what we see on the screen is like the raw ingredients of a meal : all of the expensive f/x amounts to nothing .
part of the charm of the tv series was its sly irreverence which has gone down the toilet in the condescending movie .
can kids really admire a hero so goody-two-shoes that he screams " hey !
you ran a stop sign ! "
while hanging off the back bumper of a quickly moving vehicle ?
i think that today 's children will respond better to somebody dashing , someone ultra-cool .
they ( probably ) receive enough preaching from their parents and its an insult to their intelligence to assume that they want to go to an action movie to see a father figure kick butt .
in addition to the more complex complaints above , there 's also the simple stuff : inspector gadget is boring , formulaic and achingly implausible .
there 's no feeling that the director really cares about his story : more than any other film i 've seen this year , this one really feels like it was made on an assembly line .
there 's a popular commercial ( for sprite , but that 's irrelevant ) running in movie theaters before features that spoofs the way major studios deal with projects .
it consists of studio suits discussing a fictitious ( thank god ) movie called " death slug " .
each executive gleefully presents a different merchandise tie-in ( slug taco !
slug on a stick ! ) .
at the end one of them asks " what about the movie ? "
another answers : " well , we do n't have a script yet , but we can bang one out by friday . "
they probably could have replaced " death slug " with inspector gadget .
this film contains the sort of logical contradictions and blatantly obvious adherence to formula that could have been eliminated had any attention been payed to the script .
it 's no coincidence that most good children 's entertainment these days comes from animation .
animated features take so long to maker that it becomes a labor of love for the filmmakers and they put care and pride into their work .
these kinds of films are banged out quicker and a good percentage turn out worthless , sloppy and impersonal .
the studios are becoming factories and films their assembled products .

various films seen at the seattle film festival :
it 's all true/three men on a raft ( u . s . a . , 1942/1986 ) director : orson welles
a recently uncovered one-fourth of orson welle 's planned " docu-drama " of amazing stories around the world named it 's all true , this short dealt with welle 's attempts to document the actions of several brazilian fisherman in 1942 who had become folk heroes for their fantastic voyage to rio on a raft .
while several clips of the film are seen , the short tends to spend more time trying to recount welle 's attempts to film it , despite studio problems , a staggering workload , and extremely ill fortune on the set .
impressive photography , but really only interesting to film historians .
sadie thompson ( u . s . a . , 1928 ) director : raoul walsh screenwriter : raoul walsh , from the john colton play " rain " , based on w . somerset maugham 's story " miss thompson " cast : gloria swanson , raoul walsh , lionel barrymore silent
after the discussion of the newly-restored version of frank capra 's lost horizon , where several scenes had been restored using stills , i was interested to see sadie thompson , where the last 5 minutes of the film had been destroyed many years ago .
this is the silent version of the somerset maugham short story " miss thompson " .
this is one of the most skillful silent films i have ever seen--little awkwardness , and a very clever script .
the actors : gloria swanson , raoul walsh ( who also directed and wrote the screenplay ) and especially lionel barrymore , as the hypocritical reformer who supposedly wants to save sadie 's soul , but really wants to get her between the sheets , is the absolute epitome of sanctimonious scoundrel .
swanson adds real life to the character , adding an worldly , affectionate air to the bawdy sadie .
unfortunately , the ending is rather poorly tied up ; it is difficult to know whether this is due to the lack of live-action film , or the original script .
the happy ending seems particularly poorly tied on ( i can not believe maugham 's short story ended with sadie and our hero moving to australia ) ; the stills are expected to fill in a conclusion we 've been waiting an hour and a half for .
still , it 's entertaining right up to the end ; certainly barrymore 's incredibly hammy performance ( which , nonetheless , works , perhaps due to the silent screen ) is a must for anyone who is fed up with the actions of the falwells , bakkers , and robertses of the religious worlds .
a c movie ; worth 2 . 50 if you can find it .
the pied piper ( czechoslovakia , 1986 ) director : jim barta screenwriter : kamil piza
this is an animated film from czechoslovakia that is definitely not for kids .
it tells the old folk tale of the pied piper with a twist ending i find highly appropriate , and with a lot of political comment along with it .
perhaps economic content is a better word--it certainly does n't show capitalism in a good light .
nor human nature , nor anything else , for that matter .
as you may have guessed , this is not a tgif film ; this is the kind of film you are glad is over .
not that it was n't interesting for technical reasons ; this is stop-animation that is very well done .
all the puppets have been carefully carved out of walnuts--except for the animated stuffed rats .
boy , sounds like a real comedy vehicle , does n't it ?
add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night .
some gore .
do n't bring children to this one .
do n't bring adults to this one , unless they 're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped .
blech .
. no fun whatsoever .
meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled
this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money .
his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans .
meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany .
after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think 's he 's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew 's work--while everyone think 's he 's still living in east germany .
of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there .
the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) .
still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny .
c -- $ 2 . 50 .
the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements
after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i 've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to :
1 ) be wary of french comedies .
these people like jerry lewis .
2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait .
3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as " old pouty-lips " is probably not worth watching .
4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out !
australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task .
well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards .
it 's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30 's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses .
lots and lots of horses .
the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir .
unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident .
highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor 's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it 's raining--you 'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) .
the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway .
actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that 's life .
grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you 're looking for inadvertent yuks .

1989 's " major league " was a delightful surprise .
i did n't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny .
however , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale .
that 's certainly true of " major league ii " and the most recent entry , " major league : back to the minors . "
the title is , of course , a contradiction .
should n't it be " minor league ? "
that contradiction suggests the lengths to which writer/director john warren has gone to squeeze a third movie out of the formula established by the first movie .
original stars charlie sheen and tom berenger ( who returned for " major league ii " ) are not around , leaving corbin bernsen the only original headliner to make the third movie .
the other veterans who return ( dennis haysbert as voodoo-inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka , who was introduced in " league ii " ) seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise .
the only returning cast member who produces any laughs is bob uecker as radio announcer harry doyle , inexplicably broadcasting the games of a minor league team far from his home turf .
the protagonist this time around is retiring pitcher gus cantrell ( scott bakula ) , who is hired by minnesota twins owner roger dorn ( bernsen ) to manage the twins ' aaa team , the buzz .
you can write the movie from here : he finds a group of misfits who need to learn how to play together as a team in order to win .
there 's a future superstar whose ego keeps him from growing ( walton goggins ) , an ex-ballet dancer ( kenneth johnson ) , a broken-down old timer ( thom barry ) , twin outfielders both named juan ( the difilippo triplets ) , and a couple pitchers with throwing problems ( judson mills and peter mackenzie ) .
along the way , gus picks up cerrano and tanaka ( gus is supposedly an old teammate of theirs , even though he was n't in either of the preceding films ) .
sum total : none .
the entire enterprise is artificial , and the cast is not ready for the hollywood majors .
gus ' antagonist is twins manager leonard huff ( ted mcginley ) .
leonard is a slimy , sniveling little egotist , and the twins are lazy , spoiled , and full of themselves .
( even watching the first movie i wondered why any real-life team would lend itself to being caricatured in this manner ) .
gus challenges leonard to a match , the buzz vs . the twins .
( wan na guess who wins ? )
" back to the minors " is a movie that has no reason to exist .
there 's hardly a laugh in it , the cast is weak , and the first movie left no room for even one sequel .

as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things .
i am befuddled by fight club .
now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later .
perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time .
perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them .
fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former .
maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold .
but if it is , i sure don ? t see it .
edward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer .
his insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life .
but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home .
once jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally .
they begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging .
as the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days .
i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey .
suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation .
this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table .
but with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ? .
now , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today .
advertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed .
( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced . )
all of them play an important role .
how so ?
well , i can kinda just tell .
i can ? t really put my finger on it .
to say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news .
is that bad for the world ?
probably .
not much room for social commentary there .
we all know that inter-office politics are just that . . . politics .
so what was the point of all this ?
the film seems desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were .
all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting .
( pitt , carter , norton . . . all of them are good .
even meatloaf is good . )
when you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself .
not them , because each of them would likely give you a different answer .
fight club means what you want it to mean , i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about .
but it couldn ? t be more bizarre and unappealing .
sure , it had shock value , but so did se7en and the game , and they were significantly stronger films .

ah , and 1999 was going along so well , too .
" she 's all that " has the dubious distinction of being the worst movie i 've seen so far this year .
and quite frankly , i doubt i 'll see anything equally bad .
( at least , i * hope * i do n't see anything equally bad ) .
" she 's all that " tells the story of the most popular guy in school ( played by freddie prinze jr . ) who accepts a bet to transform the geekiest girl in school ( rachel leigh cook ) into the most popular .
that , right there , is problem # 1 .
how many times have we seen this storyline ?
as cook comments near the end of the film , " it 's kind of like " pretty woman " , except without the prostitution " .
of course , had the filmmakers attempted to try something new with this material , the well-worn storyline would have been a device to propell the movie forward .
as it is , though , " she 's all that " relies * completely * on the lame and overused formula to push it ahead .
there 's not one original or interesting character in the film , either , and if that was n't bad enough , there 's not one good performance featured .
the star of the movie , rachel leigh cook , is simply horrible .
i usually do n't like to get so personal , but in this case , i think it needs to be said .
cook wears the same expression throughout the flick and looks to be having as miserable a time as i was .
i was never convinced that she was a " nerd " , and her transformation was unconvincing and unnecessary .
the movie seems to be saying it 's better to be popular than to be who you are .
as for freddie prinze jr . , an actor i ordinarily enjoy , he too is quite bad here .
he coasts through the film on so-called charm , and never establishes a real character .
kieren culkin is here , too , as the brother of cook .
and for some indiscernable reason , he 's got hearing aids .
no explanation is given and they 're never brought up .
were we supposed to feel * sorry * for him just because he wore hearing aids ?
i do n't think so .
that single element of the film was one of the most offensive things i 've seen in a movie in a long time .
" she 's all that " sucks .
that 's what it boils down to .
it 's not entertaining , and it 's not even a good time passer .
the hour and a half running time goes by slower than a 5 minute hair-removal system informercial .
and what 's worse , it sends out a bad message to teens .
it appears to be telling them , " hey , it does n't matter if you 're happy the way you are .
that 's unimportant .
if you want to * truly * be happy , dress in the latest fashions and act like a bubble-headed moron . "
ugh .

reading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy , " analyze this , " i asked myself , " how could this miss ? "
robert de niro ( " taxi driver , " " raging bull " ) , billy crystal ( " city slickers " ) , lisa kudrow ( " the opposite of sex " ) , and director harold ramis ( " national lampoon 's vacation " ) .
these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well , okay , crystal has been in a sizable slump lately ) , and tellingly , the first half-hour of " analyze this " was very funny .
unfortunately , as the running time ticked away , i began to think that the first thirty minutes had , unbeknownst to me , been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times .
the film has obtained a clever premise , but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen .
middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobel 's ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well .
although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents , especially his father , who is also a psychiatrist , ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend , laura ( lisa kudrow ) .
in little but a flash , however , ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro ) , who desperately wants counseling , even though he himself wo n't even admit to having anxiety attacks .
ben tries to help paul , mostly so he will get him off his back , but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding , which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death .
it seems to ben that no matter what he does , paul vitti will not go away , and the more they become involved , the more ben 's potentially happy life gets into danger .
" analyze this " has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time .
admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i ca n't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline .
since " analyze this " bills not one , not two , but three writers , you 'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot .
one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and are n't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop .
coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year 's best films , " clockwatchers " and " the opposite of sex , " lisa kudrow 's throwaway " girlfriend " role is an incredible step down .
sure , kudrow 's fellow " friend " jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in " office space , " but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston .
kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place .
chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character .
finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on " saturday night live " ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal 's patients and then completely disappears .
too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal .
once " analyze this " approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow 's laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben .
afterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches .
" analyze this " proves that talent can certainly help any film out , but when the written material is n't up to their level , what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air .

porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years .
they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , " town and country . "
" town and country " has a pedigree befitting it 's title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( " the graduate " ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( " funny bones " ) .
after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty 's next " ishtar . "
so , is it that bad ?
the answer is no .
but it 's not very good either .
the major problem with " town and country " is that it 's unstructured and random .
stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) .
next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin .
then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples ' divorce lawyer ) .
ellie thinks she 's overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family 's mississippi manse .
the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they 'd never become a couple to begin with .
back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter 's cheating on her .
porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he 's gay .
the four friends , along with every woman porter 's dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after .
although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere .
the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , " the virgin suicides " and tricia vessey , " kiss the girls " ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who 's just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home .
after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son .
porter 's romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled .
once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm .
while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused .
maybe we 're supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who does n't initiate his own sex romps ?
keaton 's ellie has a trusting nature that 's a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character .
hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of " the out of towners " and " the first wives ' club " while shandling 's relegated to true second banana status .
kinski is bland and unmotivated .
andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay 's most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother .
heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party .
oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like " hear my song " and " funny bones . "
the script is this film 's weakest link - it 's telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit .
while " town and country " is n't exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there .

i can imagine how good krippendorf 's tribe must have looked on paper .
it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film .
in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf 's tribe as possible .
in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been .
i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss .
dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $ 100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea .
halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies .
i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established .
later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures .
so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie .
he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video .
he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) .
audiences at krippendorf 's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision .
and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community .
like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero .
dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film .
he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically .
this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i 've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job .
jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf 's work , is also very funny and appealing here .
and the kid actors are great , as well .
but we 're talking about the script from hell .
this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen .
but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it .
all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew .
no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched .
furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless .
take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex .
they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin .
krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe .
now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , " no , that would be far too tasteless .
there 's no way they 'll do that . . . oh
god ! "
they did do it .
it 's there .
i was almost more appalled by the fact that this did n't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film .
i found it deplorable .
and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice .
the film is filled with scenes like these .
they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays .
it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon .
and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes .
if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely .
moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes .
sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes .
it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film .
his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does .
i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something .
no , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) did n't include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad .
in fact , it 's his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings .
i suppose it 's important to admit that this is a funny film .
dreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring .
and if you 're less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it .
i , however , ca n't get past these elements .
krippendorf 's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they should n't be learning .
with a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie .

watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey .
if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star .
alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .
what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .
that 's pretty generous , considering the movie 's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .
when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .
so why such a seemingly high rating ?
there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .
first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .
the sound and screen kicked ass .
nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i do n't necessarily mean that in a good way ) .
also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie 's tension .
i even liked the computer-generated settings .
i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i 've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .
also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .
william hurt is n't too bad either .
neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .
and perhaps i should n't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .
there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a " real " kiss -- no sex ) .
it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .
those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .
that type of moviemaking is a lost art .
now for the bad news .
worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .
it 's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .
" you better hold on to your joystick , " is one such line .
and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .
second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .
the story 's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what 's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .
once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .
when gary oldman easily reprograms will 's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : " he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' "
then there 's the tone of the movie .
the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .
then it could be an adventure movie .
they 're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) was n't a good enough actor to carry it off .
still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .
just because a movie is tame enough for kids does n't mean that we have to bow to a " promise keepers " notion of who 's the center of a family .
many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .
and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .
in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .
we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .
in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .
that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .
finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .
the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .
why ?
why bother saying what year this is .
just tell us it 's the future .
i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .
setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it wo n't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .
then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .
this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny 's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers have n't learned a thing about ergonomics .
one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .
the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .
this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .
but if that 's the best part of the movie , i ca n't in good conscience recommend it .
still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your " bad movie bingo " cards .

as more bodies begin to pile up , harry realizes that he will have to solve the disappearance of catherine 's first husband twenty years earlier to find out who 's willing to kill to keep that secret buried .
newman . sarandon .
hackman .
with an a-list cast of oscar laureates like that , " twilight " would seem very promising .
however , the script is tired and predictable .
it would serve well as a tv-movie-of-the-week , possibly with some 1970 's detective hero reprising his role .
the appeal of the project for its stars and its director , robert benton , is nostalgia .
" twilight " wants very much to be a 1940 's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell .
all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i .
among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation .
the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 .
elmer bernstein 's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir .
the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script .
they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters .
harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine .
jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry 's love for catherine .
catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer .
" twilight " wants to be character-driven like " nobody 's fool " ( also directed by benton , also starring newman , based on a novel by russo ) was , but the tired script gives the actors too little to work with .
" twilight " also squanders a fine supporting cast : stockard channing ( harry 's friend on the police force ) , reese witherspoon ( jack & catherine 's bratty kid ) , giancarlo esposito ( the humorous sidekick ) , john spencer ( harry 's nemesis on the force ) , liev schreiber and margo martindale ( the blackmailers ) , and james garner ( a cop who bailed movie stars out of trouble ) .

of course i knew this going in .
why is it that whenever a tv-star makes a movie it 's always a romantic comedy , and then they say on entertainment tonight or something , that they were " attracted to the characters .
they were really original . "
original ? ! let me give you a run-through of picture perfect : character a ) kate ( jennifer aniston , from tv 's friends ) , a smart , beautiful , professional woman wants two things she ca n't have : a new job-title and the love of her co-worker kevin bacon .
her boss will only give her the job if she gets married and gets a mortgage and gets a lease on a german sportscar , and kevin bacon pnly sleeps with married or involved girls .
what does she do ?
she invents a fiance !
then when everyone wants to meet him , she tells some poor schmoe she met at a wedding that she will pay him $ 1000 to pretend to be in love with her for a company dinner , and pick a fight with her at the end , thus breaking the engagement but still being able to keep her job , since the guy ends up looking like a jerk and she is the poor , defenceless female .
he , of course , goes along with it .
gee , i wonder if they get together in the end .
i 've seen more original stuff on the wb .
and better stuff too .
picture perfect also makes the mistake of being _wayyyyy_ too long at 100 minutes , and expecting us to like aniston 's character , who comes off as a cold , spoiled bitch .

the last line ( or near to that honor ) is the great butler , alfred ( the ubergod , michael gough ) saying , " i think we need a bigger bat cave , " or something to that note .
that 's exactly what this film is - too big for its own good because it has too damn much .
cut batgirl out .
cut one of the villains .
it 's too much to handle in one dosage .
it 's so much that characters get left behind .
poor elle gets a mere 3 scenes and a subplot which is introduced but never finished in any way , shape or form .
and elle deserves better .
this is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director joel schumacher .
it 's also the fourth worst in the series ( and second worst from joel ) .
the series has been declining since its stunning debut , followed by the almost-as-stunning sequel and then the anti-climactic third one ( first by joel ) .
this one 's not anti-climactic - i knew it was gon na suck .
it 's up to joel to make it fun though .
" batman forever " was fun .
this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters .
i mean , this one bit .
i 'm gon na put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who 's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days .
he 's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ?
joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body .
batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they 're growing apart .
meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he 's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had .
she emerges from her chemicals ( do n't ask 'cause i ca n't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who 's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people .
she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo .
meanwhile , alfred 's dying of the same disease mr . freeze 's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl .
meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman 's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing .
end of her for all we know .
mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( do n't ask ! ! ! ) .
the trio must team together " as family " to beat them .
there ya go .
not the whole story but no big context clues .
too much , right ?
right !
the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels .
however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one .
he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that 's it .
maybe some stunts .
for all this , i ca n't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy !
and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say .
i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode .
george is in between them .
he 's not quintessential , he 's not horrible , he 's good .
but i 'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they 'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we 'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) .
the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher .
last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey .
this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze .
we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ?
arnold is n't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points .
when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber .
wow .
but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness .
it 's like she 's almost parodying herself in " pulp fiction " at points .
she 's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better .
as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in " batman forever , " although i think his work in these is too hokey when he 's best at quieter parts in " scent of a woman " or just plain cool parts in " fried green tomotoes . "
alicia - i love the girl but she 's not particularly good in this film .
she can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in " clueless , " but her lines kinda sound weird .
and it is n't the mushy-mouth this time .
but in all fairness , she has virtually no part .
joel gets around to her occasionally and when she 's on , she does stupid stuff . . . although
i know i 'm not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . .
and poor elle .
poor , poor elle .
i love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw " sirens " ) .
but she has no part ! ! !
it seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product .
there are no " couch " scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) .
now listen to me on this one - in every " batman " flick , there 's a couch scene .
in the original , it was with vicki .
in " returns , " it was a good make-out scene with selena .
and in the last one , it was a chat with nicole .
this one , it 's nothing .
and batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she 's suddenly " part of the family . "
fortunately , we get a lot of alfred .
he 's the always reliable butler , in case you did n't know , who has been with bruce all his life .
he 's a god .
he 's a father figure .
he 's also dying .
this got to me .
i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me .
we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but
this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered .
but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma .
for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do .
and there are some nice touches .
when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient 's belongings in a room and we see the riddler 's costume .
i laughed .
and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as " droogs " from " a clockwork orange . "
i laughed at all these .
the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or
did it just feel like that ?
the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays .
people are fed up with stupid films .
that 's why the word of mouth killed " the lost world ! "
that 's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever .
that 's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it .
that 's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo 's " face/off " and barry sonnenfeld 's " men in black , " both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on .
i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste .
i like some of his films ( " flatliners , " " a time to kill " ) but a lot of them suck .
he 's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that 's what makes him great .
but his costuming for woody allen 's " sleeper " was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) .
i love the " batman " series .
the first two rocked and i did like the last one .
but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three .
hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time .
and maybe they 'll get smart and bring back catwoman .
and michael keaton .
but we can only hope .

if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that do n't look particularly good because i 'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it .
if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : " shay casey : seeing bad movies so you do n't have to . "
but i know that 's bunk-you 're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say .
so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie .
you know the feeling , when you 're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly .
sometimes i think that 's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever .
admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies .
so do i .
so i saw " supernova . "
truth be told , " supernova " was n't quite as bad as i thought it might be .
maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio had n't started tinkering with the director 's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed .
maybe i 'm becoming a softy .
in any case , i did n't find " supernova " as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe .
but it 's still bad .
the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel " nightingale . "
the crew includes captain a . j .
marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) .
there are some attempts at " characterization , " but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) .
do n't expect any more explanation , because you wo n't get it .
anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent .
during the dimension jump ( i think that 's what it 's called , but do n't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board .
he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with .
then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening .
have you seen " alien ? "
have you seen " event horizon " ( a lame movie in its own right ) ?
good .
then you 've seen " supernova . "
post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either .
after all , no one 's going to think for a second that troy wo n't turn out to be a villain .
but the bigger problem with " supernova " is that it can ' t just stick to the simple plot it 's afforded .
numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it 's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped .
was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ?
did the ship 's computer learn something about humanity ?
what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ?
and just what does the film 's title signify , if anything ?
as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that is n't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements .
character relationships in this film also make very little sense .
for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex .
we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes .
bassett and spader 's characters start off hating each other .
fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they 're engaging in some hanky-panky .
when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him .
every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut .
the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits !
furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits .
maybe that 's why the film 's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster .
right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you 're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations .
the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby .
point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing .
does n't make sense .
since i did n't understand anything about these characters ' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ?
not a whit .
it 's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do .
they do n't find it .
bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces .
sexual tension ?
more like constipation .
maybe they 're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as " this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . "
not that we ever find out who that is , mind you .
the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film 's biggest forehead-slapper .
as troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected .
he ' s awfully one-note , but it 's not as if he 's given any more notes to work with .
the rest of the cast does even less .
tunney stands around looking cute , then scared .
phillips broods .
cruz flirts with the computer .
then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really was n't paying much attention by then .
" supernova " is pretty awful , but i 'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got .
that 's it .
if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you 'll probably hate it more than i will .
even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven ' t seen before , and suffice to say the script is n't going to save the film .
honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ?
it usually results in a bad movie , and that 's what " supernova " is .

" mandingo " has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , " a trashy potboiler " that " appeals only to the s&m crowd . "
actually , i think " mandingo " is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts .
it 's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash .
the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) .
one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) .
although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley .
according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves .
hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him .
hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves .
meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild .
hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his " bed wench , " the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex .
it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche .
hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had " pleasured " her before he did .
of course , it 's fine that he 's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a " white lady , " had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her .
so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen .
blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child .
hammond and his father can not stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it 's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche .
hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water .
yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive .
judging only by the plot , " mandingo " is pure sexploitation .
the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society .
when " mandingo " was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs .
dramatically , " mandingo " is weak and unfocused , and historically it 's mostly confused .
if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics .
not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants .
the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner .
there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but " mandingo 's " overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there 's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) .
some tried to write off " mandingo " as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it 's not that easy .
" mandingo " was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as " the bible " ( 1966 ) , the remake of " king kong " ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated " dune " ( 1984 ) .
the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " ( 1954 ) and " fantastic voyage " ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as " the narrow margin " ( 1952 ) .
the script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on " serpico . "
james mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career .
so why is " mandingo " so bad ?
a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job .
wexler 's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( " yessuh , massuh " ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( " fer whut 're you gittin ' outta bed ? " ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( " if you see me hang , you gon na know you killed a black brother ! " ) .
fleischer 's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable .
nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due .
despite its exploitative nature , " mandingo " was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery .
until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery .
even classics such as " gone with the wind " ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter .
" mandingo " reassessed the south , and showed that it was n't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets .
but all this is constantly undermined by the film 's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners .
with a little more maturity and different handling , " mandingo " might have been an effective , worthwhile film .
while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them .
the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler 's script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing .
there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but " mandingo " never does it .
steven spielberg touched on that same topic in " schindler 's list " ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid .
the difference between that film and " mandingo " is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma .
" mandingo " is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its " trashy potboiler " nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished .

plot : token director alan smithee steals the only copy of his film " trio " from the studio , after they complete the " final cut " without him .
he threatens to burn the film reel if they do not allow him to keep his vision .
critique : wow .
i really ca n't remember the last time a movie sucked on so many levels !
the " comedy " in this film is pathetic , obvious and dated ( oj simpson jokes galore ) .
the plot is uninteresting , boring and bad .
the structure of the film is annoying , repetitive and pretentious .
the acting is pretty bad , especially jackie chan , who ca n't act to save his life .
the cameos are lame and seem forced , and the ending blows chunks .
all in all , this movie believes itself to be a clever , humorous and edgy look behind the closed doors of hollywood , but comes across as a boring , stupid and completely unentertaining piece of shite .
i love to see movies about hollywood shenanigans , but this one bites the big one .
see it if you like to watch really bad movies , otherwise skip it , because it will just have you hating every star that makes an appearance in it .
luckily for us all , this mess only lasts about 80 minutes , and miramax honcho harvey weinstein plays a lead-faced detective .
by the way , is there any reason why the studio or the producer could n't have cut another version of the film by the way of all the filmed stock that was left over ?
who knows , who cares , this " satire " sucks the bag .
little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically , the original director of this film , arthur hiller , also requested his name be taken off the credits and replaced by the dga 's alan smithee moniker .
this was after the film 's production company , cinergi pictures , preferred the cut made by producer/writer joe eszterhas to his .
the original script of this film included arnold schwarzenegger and bruce willis .
eszterhas announced through the media during post-production that cinergi pictures did n't have the money to pay for soundtrack .
he said that he would finance the soundtrack from his own money and asked to submit tracks for it to him .
he received 9 , 200 cds and cassettes from mostly unknown and unsigned artists , listened to all that was sent ( at least a couple of tracks from each record ) and compiled the soundtrack .
this film practically swept the " razzie awards " in 1999 , given out to the worst of all movie categories of the year , with no less than the " worst picture " award , the " worst screenplay " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst supporting actor " ( joe eszterhas ) , the " worst new star " ( joe eszterhas tied with jerry springer ) and the " worst original song " ( " i wan na be mike ovitz ! "
as written by joe eszterhas ) .

five girls spend a day in a closed building doing inventory when a strange box gets delivered there ( is this starting to sound familiar ? ) by mistake .
the girls accidentlly open the box ( big surprise , huh ! ) and release an evil spirit of a killer that kills the girls off one by one ( betcha did n't see that one coming ! ) .
hard to die , i found out while watching the film , is a sequel to sorority house massacre 2 : nightie nightmare ( r . a . m . r . #
1521 ) .
two of the actresses from sorority house massacre 2 are in this film , robyn harris and melissa moore , but they play different characters here .
orville ketchum is also back as ( get ready for this ) orville ketchum ( yes , the same character from number two ) .
yes , he is also built like a tank in this film too .
i 'm telling you , a nuclear bomb detonated next to this man would n't harm him at all !
the before mentioned three were the only actors from part two that i thought could act , well they seemed to have lost that ability .
thankfully , for my sanity , i also saw the film warlock , which undid all the ill effects that i got from this film .
the story for this film is completely ridiculous and has many elements from many cheapo low budget horror flicks .
any good moments that this film fails to make are even more destroyed by the story line .
the film is so pathetically predictable that every moment has already been figured out , analyzed , and discarded before it happens .
there is no point in this film that any suspense is ever afoot .
while we are on the subject of the story , the story also provides every chance it can to disrobe an actress .
the film goes to the extent of putting a shower in the manager 's office .
i 'm sorry folks but this is completely unnecessary , ridiculous , and hurts the story more ( if that is still possible ) .
the script for this film is completely pathetic .
the lines the actresses come out with are completely horrible .
the only thing that i think could have happened is that the actors made up the script as they went along .
here is an example of the wonderful dialog .
the scene is two girls have just entered a gun store and have picked out a * really * big gun .
the line is " my dad used to be a marine , i bet i can work it . "
this line has got to be a contender for the bad line hall of infamy .
now , we fast forward for a few minutes until just after a big plan ( ? ! ! ? ) has been presented .
one comment from an actress is " not a lot of strategy involved , but i like it . "
i 'm afraid folks that this is about as good as they get .
now lets talk about the great special effects for this film .
this obviously was n't a big concern of the film makers .
the killing scenes are so obviously faked that they go to the point of threatening the viewer 's intelligence .
a girl gets hacked with a knife and enough blood comes out to do one friday the 13th movie .
are we trying to see how unrealistic we can get ?
the continuity department was obviously asleep ( along with the viewers ) when watching this film .
in one shot , actress has cloths on , camera angle changes , actress seems to have lost clothing .
very impressive trick !
the one ( half ? )
plus that this film has going for it , is that in many places it is unintentionally hilarious .
the incompetence behind the film makes it incredibly funny , and so the viewer can get some enjoyment ( ? ! ! ? ) from the film .
however , this does n't make it worth the rental fee of over a penny .
in the acting department , the only thing i can say is two thumbs squared and one head down .
i would normally do a detailed paragraph on this topic , but there is no point here because there is nobody that i was impressed with in the least .
oh well , win some , lose some .

dear god , this is a fantastically bad film !
regardless of what i say about knock off , you ca n't grasp its awfulness from my words .
you have to see it and experience it for yourself .
here 's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so .
yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure .
in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story .
do n't get me wrong : i 'm not excusing knock off .
it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it 's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was .
it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme .
it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark .
as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness .
now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it was n't , but it 's still a fascinating kind of mess .
i do n't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i 'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off .
for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing .
i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) .
i do n't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film .
ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there 's no problem .
rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film .
lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once !
in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do .
in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense .
but what a strange mess it is .
it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours .
can this be the same man ?
i do n't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time .
knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there 's no semblance here .
for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he 's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong .
why ?
who knows .
what are the implications of this ?
i have no idea .
most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem .
knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut .
the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity .
sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this .
van damme is bad , but he 's charming in that bad way , and so i ca n't say that he 's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) .
the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time .
tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison .
they 're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe .
but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed .
lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes ' first encounter with the rochon character .
but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ?
i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought .
knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania .
if it were boring , i 'd give it zero stars .
but it 's not boring : it 's loud and excessive and completely incoherent .
it 's also funny , even when it is n't meaning to be funny .
a bad film that succeeds as entertainment does n't deserve to be fully lambasted .
i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i ca n't deny it 's zany , useless charm .
oh , i know , they 're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they 're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts .
it 's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that does n't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful .

romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant .
with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination .
those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay .
call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer do n't seem to mix well .
gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife .
his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name does n't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character .
jack has become addicted to " feeding the hole " , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money .
when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out .
gary oldman 's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored .
in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider .
demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world .
this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i ca n't remember seeing a character quite like her .
after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety .
what a woman !
lena olin 's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film .
anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo 's wife .
there is little insight into her character .
she 's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house .
juliette lewis , as romeo 's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis ' portrayal certainly did n't improve it .
both women were anything but sexy or attractive .
poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems .
it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something .
for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene .
fine .
jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite .
fine .
what does jack proceed to do ?
he brushes his friends off by telling them he is n't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss .
why ?
the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack 's toes by the gravesite .
i guess they were n't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . .
or here 's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw .
she proceeded to set the place on fire .
would n't the flames burn off the fingerprints ?
are n't dental records more important ?
as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , could n't she come up with a better plot ?
( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . )
lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film .
this film does n't even add up the large details .
there is little or no consistency in the story-line .
not much makes sense .
the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable .
the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one .
so while it certainly is n't reservoir dogs , it certainly is n't diva .
there 's plenty more to tear apart in this film .
my advice to someone who has n't seen it to to wait until it comes on video .
there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously .
it 's not a boring film , just not a good one .
or an intelligent one .

whether you like the beatles or not , nobody wants to see the bee gee 's take on some of the fab four 's best known songs .
well , maybe that 's not true .
.
.
maybe you 're curious , the way you have to look in your hanky after you blow your nose .
you just have to know how bad bad can be .
if that 's the case , rejoice , because it was twenty years ago today ( or so ) that sgt .
pepper 's lonely hearts club band was released ( unleashed ? ) to the world , and thanks to our modern technological advances , you can find this retched piece of filmmaking on vhs .
derived from the lyrics of various beatles ' songs , sgt .
pepper 's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song ( and album ) of the same name , released in 1967 .
of course , the movie was made eleven years later , the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts , peter frampton is the one and only billy shears , and aside from being about a rock band , the story does n't correlate to the song at all .
and oh , what joy - we 're the lovely audience they 'd like to take home with them .
i do n't think so .
but at least these characters are actually * people * in a beatles ' song , whereas other characters such as strawberry fields ( sandy farina ) gets her name from a song about a * place * called strawberry fields .
the debate over this is really quite futile when it comes down to it , because all the film really has to offer is a feast of horrid cover tunes , embarrassing cameo appearances ( george burns ? !
steve martin ? ! ?
alice cooper ? ! ? ! ) , and uuuuuuggggggglllllllyyyyy 70 's fashion and faces .
check please !
the plot is a bit unclear .
people with bad 70 's hair run around in leisure suits engaging in music video sequences that look like a sick and twisted world of make-believe from an overly demented mr . rogers .
mean mr . mustard ( frankie howerd ) somehow gets hold of all billy & co . 's instruments , calling dr . maxwell edison ( steve martin with a silver hammer and an out-of-key singing voice ) , the sun king , marvin sunk ( alice cooper ! ) , and a couple of creepy robots to his aid .
supposedly this is a horrible thing ?
i guess in heartland , the talent is pretty non-existent .
meanwhile , the lonely hearts are off doing the classic " sex , drugs , and rock n ' roll " thing , leaving poor strawberry fields without her true love , billy .
she sets out to find him , leaving her poor dad and mom ( mrs .
fields !
hey , wan na cookie ? )
all alone to sing a horrible rendition of " she 's leaving home " , accompanied by those same creepy robots .
but is billy getting it on with lucy ( dianne steinberg ) ?
ya know , the diamond possessing girl who hangs out in the sky ?
well , there 's some crazy chick singing soprano on the roof of a building next to a bus stop , and i assume that 's who it was .
it 's movies like this that make ya sit back and ask the unanswerable question , " what the hell were they thinking ? ? ? "
nobody will ever know , but as a novelty , sgt .
pepper 's is one to examine .
carol channing , robert palmer , keith carradine - they 're all here .
but why ? ? ? ?
who knows .
it 's irrelevant .
there 's as much meaning to be found here as there is to be found in your belly-button lint , although the latter may be more interesting .
with the recent onslaught of 70 's nostalgia in the movie world ( the ice storm , boogie nights , reissues of the star wars trilogy , etc . ) , let 's pray this does n't get a special 20th anniversary , second-chance in theaters .
in the words of paul mccartney , live and let die .
in fact , bury this one while you still can .

for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues .
i would give it one half of a star for guts .
anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts .
i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show .
the script was the worst part .
they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh .
they had lots of " great " sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door .
turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show .
the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left .
buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies .
tell them the show is great and smile a lot .
* * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year .
a must see film .
* * * = excellent show .
look for it .
* * = average movie .
kind of enjoyable .
* = poor show .
do n't waste your money .
0 = one of the worst films of this or any year .
totally unbearable .

the first image in " final fantasy : the spirits within " is a computer-animated close-up of a human eye .
it 's a beautiful piece of work , remarkably detailed and quite convincing .
when the picture pulls back to reveal the owner of the eye , however , things change .
the young woman has mesmerizing hair , although it hangs too artfully ? even by movie standards ? to be believed .
the facial features are more detailed than any computer-animation seen to date , but the result is more reminiscent of a very well-crafted doll than anything human .
she is pretty , but bland , and not nearly expressive enough to come off like a person .
all the characters in " final fantasy " are like that .
of the core group , the younger white men and women are all athletic , attractive and indistinct , like applicants for a tv reality show .
the black man is taller and burlier , and the aging scholar is bald , with wrinkles and a beard .
none of them appear to be based on individuals ; they all look like the products of general descriptions given a police sketch artist .
it gets worse when they talk and move .
why is the sarcastic voice of steve buscemi , he of the great twisted face and snaggleteeth , coming out of the mouth of some dreary ken doll ?
why , for every fluid physical gesture , do we also see herky-jerky puppet-style motions ?
more to the point , who decided a full-length computer animated movie featuring " hyperreal " ( their term , not mine ) humanoids was a good idea ?
" final fantasy " is based on a phenomenally popular video game i 've never played , with a story straight out of japanese anime , which more often than not leaves me bored and depressed .
if you 're a fan of either , please spare me your letters , as i will focus solely on the finished film and not its source materials .
with an expression-challenged cast , " final fantasy " mixes turgid action scenes with heaps of mystical shit .
the result is ugly , confusing and boring .
note : the following reveals the basic plot .
if you want to have a fighting chance of making any sense of the movie , i suggest you read it .
earth is at war with aliens that appear to feed on human souls .
most of our planet is devastated , with humans living in a few protected cities .
while the bulk of the survivors focus on military strategies , aki ross ( voiced by ming-na ) and her mentor , dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) , believe in a more organic approach .
they operate on the notion ( quoting straight from the press kit ) " that all life forms have signature spirit waves that can be identified and contained .
aki and dr . sid collect a series of organic specimens whose spirit signatures combined will form a wave of equal and opposite intensity to the spirit wave of the alien force .
the waves will , in effect , cancel each other out and disarm the foreign contagion .
they have collected six of the eight key spirits needed to complete their wave .
they are on a desperate hunt to find the remaining two spirits before their time runs out . "
are you still with me ?
there 's only a little more .
aki is infected with the alien force .
dr . sid has developed a method of confining the contagion and keeping it from killing her , but the defense wall wo n't hold much longer .
already , the alien is communicating with aki through her dreams .
aiding aki and dr . sid are the deep eyes , a group of hard-as-nails types that would have felt at home with the troops in " aliens . "
capt . gray edwards ( alec baldwin ) heads the task force that consists of a wise guy ( buscemi ) , a tough woman ( peri gilpin ) and a gentle giant ( ving rhames ) .
throwing a monkey wrench into the plans is the requisite dumb ass : in this case general hein ( james woods ) , who wants to use the zeus cannon to bomb the aliens back to the stone age , even if it destroys earth as well .
so there you have it .
like most of the anime i 've seen , the plot combines apocalyptic settings , lots of shooting and fuzzy spirituality , all wrapped up in a save-the-earth bow .
but i 'm bored with apocalyptic settings .
i understand why so many live-action films employ them ? they 're cheap ? but animated films can show anything , so why wallow in an industrial trash heap ?
the action scenes and shoot-em-ups do n't satisfy either .
the humans move oddly and their facial features are so muted that the talented voice cast ca n't bring them to life ( in fact , their efforts merely emphasize what we 're missing ) .
aki is especially disappointing ; with her lack of expression and flat delivery , she looks and sound like a brunet version of weena , the eloi girl from 1960 's " the time machine . "
drab color choices and aliens that appear to have been created in jell-o molds sap the pizzazz from the big set pieces .
students of computer animation may be fascinated with the technology behind " final fantasy : the spirits within , " but i found it sub-par across the board .
" futurama " does more effective battle visuals , the kids in " south park " are far more expressive than these mannequins and any old episode of the contemporary version of " the outer limits " does better doom and gloom sci-fi .
so who needs this ?
not me .

a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge .
at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise .
after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville 's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom .
the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . .
and , ultimately ( did n't we see this one coming ? ) ,
love .
so far , so mediocre .
but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge 's contextual frame for the romance .
it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven 's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status .
this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture .
but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand .
not that there is much of a romance to begin with .
try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters .
celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard .
as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other .
when celine and robert start to overtly act on their " feelings , " it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural .
but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company 's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish .
boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting .
the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling .
and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue .
watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool .
instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name .
my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing " beyond the sea " at a karaoke bar .
after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter .
the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport .
alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end .
i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill .
a life less ordinary certainly delivers something " different , " but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary .
" i can accept failure .
everyone fails at something .
but i ca n't accept not trying .
it does n't matter if you win as long as you give everything in your heart . "

note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .
be forewarned .
i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species .
squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $ 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley 's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ai n't ) .
miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they 'd dare tempt fate and go for another round .
so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid .
the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can .
in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there 's a catch -- he 's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who 's now infected with alien dna .
patrick 's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring .
and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick 's primary focus turns to her -- " if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable " warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction .
species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around .
however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered .
mr . brancato 's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches .
like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there 's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious .
last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker 's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- " something bad happened here . "
this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter " this is awful . "
and she 's not even empathic !
and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who 's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , " he 's going to rape her . "
while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own .
there 's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which does n't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( " he 's in aisle 1 ! "
informs eve ) .
if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion .
much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it 's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief .
the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve 's brain ?
why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ?
my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks .
this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it 's being foisted upon the public .
returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there 's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis .
mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick 's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film .
mr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) .
ms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that " she 's so empowered . "
a lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that 's * what i call empowerment .

this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash .
this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life .
yes , there are elements of ? fargo ' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department .
it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives .
and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty .
although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way .
this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there .
the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money .
they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance .
commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful .
bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems .
fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath .
it 's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you 're the menendez brothers .

in my opinion , a movie reviewer 's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion .
but with soul survivors , i 'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned .
however , protocol forces me to do otherwise .
soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent .
party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) .
matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) .
driving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash .
sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her .
as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him .
along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party .
annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass 's visions .
she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself .
rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material .
in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion .
when the movie 's camerawork is n't pedestrian , it 's clich ? d .
carpenter 's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation .
we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ?
and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here .
carpenter 's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness .
this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around .
the second lamest device , of course , is the , " oh , it was all a dream " resolution .
and guess what ?
this movie has both !
not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile .
since there 's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere .
that 's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples .
carpenter ca n't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it .
[ the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats .
-ed . ]
when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts .
and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they 're fully clothed .
regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity .
why would n't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ?
why would they shower in their clothes ?
what if they were n't covered in latex paint ?
the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes .
i felt sorry for affleck , who i 've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty .
dushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan .
as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking .
and i 'm not even getting into luke wilson 's role as a priest .
at least he 's friends with wes anderson .
bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .

godzilla is a nuclear freak .
he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years and has become a new species , one that has a foot as long as this bus , and a claw as long as this sign .
this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific islands .
he tore up a ship that carried dozens of japanese men .
one survived .
only he was left to recount the terror that he had seen .
he was merely able to repeat the words " godzilla . . . godzilla . . . godzilla " .
the film then introduces us to matthew broderick , a biologist who has been studying the fascinating growth of chernobyl earthworms .
" they 're 17 % larger than they used to be ! " he proclaims .
the u . s . military pulls him off this three year project and assigns him to figure out what godzilla is .
and , boy , does he find out .
and , boy , does godzilla suck .
i hate to use such a word in a review , something that is supposed to inform my audience , but i really need to drive this one home and i refuse to use explitives .
it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movie saw the final cut and said , " ok !
it 's great !
let 's show this puppy . "
roland emmerich needs a good horse whipping .
his latest piece of trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece of modern american cinema .
and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films , emmerich and his team of talent-challenged imbeciles would never have had a clue as to how the creature should look .
let me give you a few examples of this terrible attempt at filmmaking .
i plan on giving some things away here .
belive me , godzilla holds no surprises for anyone with an iq higher than their shoe size , so . . . no
worries .
however , if you are looking for that " first time thrill " and you refuse to let me do you this favor , by all means , stop reading now .
a . ) godzilla makes his first ever attack in the pacific islands .
he next strikes in new york city .
um . . . anyone have a map handy ?
b . ) the mayor of new york city is a heavy set individual with parted gray hair and thick glasses .
his name is mayor ebert .
his assistant is named gene .
gene gives ebert a thumbs down at the end of the film .
i could n't make this up if i tried , folks .
c . ) stay with me on this one . . .
ok .
godzilla can out run torpedoes .
hank azaria can out run godzilla babies .
( which look more like jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors . )
d . ) the u . s . military , upon realization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city , decides that he " might be hiding in a building . "
e . ) ( oh yeah , i can go all the way to e . ) godzilla strikes at manhattan .
manhattan , an island approximately the size of san francisco holds three million people .
they evactuate to new jersey in about one day .
no problem .
f . ) early on , they bait godzilla with fish .
( he likes fish , you know . )
the thing is on an island .
the atlantic ocean is three steps east , but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fifth and 57th . . . oh
he 's gon na come running .
g . ) you know what ?
i 'll stop with the list now . . . the
alphabet is n't big enough anyway .
the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year old do a re-write .
" the kid is good ! " he must have said .
maria pitillo is looking to become a name in hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster .
bad move , maria .
acting does n't get much worse than her turn as broderick 's ex-flame .
matthew broderick is a good actor , but you 'd never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his you 'd seen .
jean reno needs to pick his american films a bit more carefully .
at times , godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker , abrahams , zucker film .
( airplane ! , naked gun . )
the jokes are indeed that bad .
but just when you think the filmmakers are having fun with you , they take themselves seriously .
how dare they !
godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags and fart jokes .
at least then we would know we were supposed to laugh .
each and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid and i was really pulling for the beast to kill more of them .
emmerich did do one thing , though .
( and i 've no idea if it was intentional . )
he made me sympathize with godzilla .
his attackers were so damn dumb that i felt sorry for him being pelted with bullets and missles .
but what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his famous name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced .

i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies .
luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !
i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i could n't help myself . . .
i got it .
well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i did n't dish out $ 7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie .
this movie really sucks .
it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !
for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ?
jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail .
the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar 's ) , and the direction is the worst of all .
the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up .
i did n't even finish the movie . . .
i could n't take it anymore .
note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you 'd like this movie .
it 's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff .
aditya panscholi is the sidekick again .
( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little .
he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it was n't his best , was the only saving grace of the movie )

8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery .
nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe .
the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie ' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed .
all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not .
welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide .
although the 'snuff ' industry has n't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most .
the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away .
8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you have n't seen from another standard thriller .
the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage .
while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . )
here , in 8mm , he 's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice .
and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up .
only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent .
his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he 's just purely enjoyable to watch .
catherine keener is completely wasted as cage 's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves .
her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year .
also fun is fargo 's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director .
as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch .
unlike seven , 8mm is n't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives .
lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment .
but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it 's just not very disturbing .
schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly ' of the porn industry , it does n't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point .
also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it 's amazing to think it 's the same film you 're watching .
8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed ' opportunity .
with a boring lead character , 'controversial ' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller .
ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like .
and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .

one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself .
such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch .
made in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , " warped , twisted masterpiece " of lynch clan .
kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract .
but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion .
the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair .
cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship .
during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her .
after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh 's stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping .
she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms .
apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch has n't got anything in common with the works of director 's more talented father .
despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray .
jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos .
the actors are n't good either .
julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic does n't suit him .
bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena 's boyfriend .
sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting could n't help this film .
the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer 's diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion .
one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh 's " regular " girlfriend , played by betsy clarke .
the twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated .
all in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger 's career .

lauded as a genius by many , stanley kubrick commands a superlative filmography that includes such critically-acclaimed films as " 2001 : a space odyssey , " " a clockwork orange , " " lolita , " and " dr .
strangelove , or : how i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb . "
now , sadly , he 's added " eyes wide shut " to that impeccable body of work and his final film is the first and only blot on his near-flawless copybook .
kubrick , alas , should have quit while he was ahead .
this much-publicized psycho-sexual tease-a-thon , with its star billing of real-life marrieds tom cruise and nicole kidman , is nothing more than one long ( two-and-a-half hours long ) boring exercise that features kubrick operating with talent wide shut .
kubrick , faithless to arthur schnitzler 's 1926 novella " dream story , " has confused eroticism with nudity .
he has confused intellectualism with talking slowly .
he has confused profundity with pretentiousness .
in addition , the director has made some strange casting choices , leaving sydney pollack in and leaving accomplished performers harvey keitel and jennifer jason leigh out .
pollack , the director of such box-office hits as " tootsie " and " out of africa , " is normally solid in his occasional acting stints but here he 's miserably out of his depth . . .
and there is n't much depth to begin with !
unhappily , there 's not likely to be a director 's cut of this film to determine whether the decision to exorcise keitel and leigh was the right one .
in fact , with the exception of the stark black-and-white credits , snatches of baroque music on the soundtrack , and many , many grainy tracking shots down lavishly-decorated corridors , there 's none of kubrick 's trademark brilliance in this film .
it does n't help that the story , as delivered , is ridiculous .
cruise and kidman , who bring little more than marital torpor to the project , play well-to-do new yorkers bill and alice harford .
he 's a doctor and she 's an unemployed art gallery director and they share a central park west address .
at an opulent party hosted by their friend victor ziegler ( pollack ) , alice gets a little tipsy and starts dancing with a jeremy irons-like hungarian , who 's singularly determined to get her in the sack .
bill , too , is seen arm-in-arm with a couple of models before he 's pulled away to deal with an overdoser .
back home , bill and alice smoke a little pot before alice 's aggressive jealousy kicks in .
as retribution , she confesses to her husband that she once had deep feelings for a naval officer she eyeballed at a hotel where she and bill once stayed .
this hurtful admission sends bill into a tailspin ; he pounds the streets of the village in his heavy black overcoat struggling with black-and-white images of alice in the grip of a horny midshipman .
it 's all way too much for him .
for revenge , bill almost has sex with a hooker .
he almost has feelings for a underage girl he sees in a costume store .
then he almost does the hooker 's roommate .
and he 's almost involved in an overblown rococo orgy when an old college chum of his tips him off to a mysterious , password-protected party where everyone wears masks and " the women are incredible " ( i . e . , naked ) .
this " erotic " set piece , a cult-ish bacchanal complete with chanting , incense , and lots of strategically-placed partygoers covering up the dirty , might impress the likes of hugh hefner , but it 's a lot less shocking than it 's intended to be .
what 's the big deal ?
bill does n't exactly * do * anything ( other than throw his money and credentials around ) , and alice only ever lusted in her heart .
whoop-dee-doo .
still , they make up at the same agonizingly slow pace--was kubrick , notorious for multiple takes , paying them at an hourly rate ?
even geniuses have their bad days .
" eyes wide shut " just happens to be kubrick 's bad day , an unerotic , disappointing , and altogether pointless end to an otherwise memorable career .

when considering david fincher 's latest film , " the game " , four words come to mind .
" do n't believe the hype . "
this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of " seven " , is n't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe .
the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy .
this is n't simply virtual reality .
this is real life with a deadly twist .
on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn ) .
conrad has a special birthday present for his brother .
he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services .
" they make your life fun , " conrad tells him .
nicholas humors his brother , telling him he 'll call , but it 's clear he has no time for any foolish , " fantasy role-playing , " as he calls it .
then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they 're all about .
he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have .
nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening .
of course , when we 've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect .
douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands .
one of those films , " basic instinct " , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven .
the premise of " the game , " is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , " total recall . "
in that case , the premise was implanting someone else 's memories as a way to enhance one 's own life through a dream vacation .
yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience .
we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn .
in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what is n't .
all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed .
now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again .
" do n't believe the hype . "
" the game " is not a thrilling roller coaster ride .
as a suspense-thriller , it does n't do much but spin in circles .
by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot .
is it any wonder douglas wo n't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ?
no ? well , how about sharon stone ?
thought so ) .
if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you have n't seen that many films .
there is no suspense here .
trust me , i looked hard to find some .
i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations .
fincher aim 's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas .
there are those that might say " the game " is not intended to be viewed literally .
i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film .
the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues .
there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who 's in on the whole thing .
he is charged by his paranoia .
he is looking at the world through new eyes .
it is the last thought-provoking moment in the film .
from there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us .
any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device .
at the outset , we 're told each " game " is tailored to the individual .
ultimately , this " game " is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul .
yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we 're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is .
i wanted to like this film more than i did .
i look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized .
i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film did n't mean we were seeing what was really happening .
bryan singer 's " the usual suspects " for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas .
also , there is the underrated " jacob 's ladder , " with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism .
here are two examples of films that do n't simply manipulate for manipulations ' sake .
there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place .
one major issue that comes up in " the game " is whether or not the whole " illusion " is just a highly sophisticated con game .
well , i can tell you right now , after you 've spent your $ 7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing .

one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet 's " gloria , " a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre .
suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in .
when a movie is over , are n't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ?
i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and # 2 , even if i had been with someone there would n't have been anything to talk about in the first place .
to be sure , " gloria " begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy 's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it .
right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with .
eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment .
meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she did n't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .
when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude .
gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( do n't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with .
the previous incarnation of " gloria " by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i ca n't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars .
there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it is n't completely unbearable to watch .
i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again .
these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers .
throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , " who really cares ? "
as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly does n't sound realistic at all .
in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone 's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better .
although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored .
jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag .
all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria 's friend whom she turns to for help .
sony , the studio that released " gloria , " obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i do n't blame them .
they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved .
although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular " in dreams , " which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion " gloria " is going to vanish from theaters faster than " ishtar , " judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself .
although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995 's " casino " or 1996 's " last dance " if you do n't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of " gloria " was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .

tv 's buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in " simply irresistible . "
sarah michelle gellar , that never-ceasing crusader against never-ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network , here plays a down-on-her-luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals .
taste test results : some vampire slaying , though out of place , would have really livened this excruciating movie up .
" simply irresistible " is actually quite easy to deny , a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on .
gellar 's amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom ( sean patrick flannery of powder ) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking , a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public 's in her tiny tribeca eatery .
all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story , a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993 's mexican classic " like water for chocolate . "
several differences : one , " like water " did n't have a telekinetic crab , and two , " like water " was a good film .
" simply irresistible , " on the other hand , is about as challenging as an easy-bake oven .
amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness , from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger - though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish .
the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals , but it 's not like you 're were going to miss much .
in fact , take away the few instances of salty language and this has made-for-disney channel written all over it .
but a majority of " simply irresistible " 's resistibility factor has less to do with the afore-mentioned overkill than the bland leads - tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there 's just no fun rooting for their inevitable " happily ever after . "
nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense , so we 're left with a ho-hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs ; it 's not going to last long , people .
perhaps sensing this , the filmmakers have piled on weird supporting characters for acting vets like betty buckley , dylan baker and patricia clarkson , but they do n't go anywhere either .
in fact , nothing in " simply irresistible " goes anywhere save for gellar , and she does n't go somewhere so much as you wish she 'd go _somewhere_ - like to a better movie .
already proving major talent with relatively few big- and small-screen roles , she 's the sole reason this overcooked souffle is n't completely fit for the garbage disposal , looking smashing in her todd oldham-designed duds and investing much more in her perfunctory part than she ever gets in return .
it 's certainly a dish best not served in it 's current condition , but one can only guess that , without gellar , " simply irresistible " would be strictly unwatchable .

all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood .
ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante 's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year .
but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank .
no number of name changes can help this picture .
it 's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster .
hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute .
the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises .
the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies .
from that moment on , it 's all downhill .
whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point .
it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured .
basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs .
there 's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions .
it 's all very routine and uninteresting because there are n't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense .
the film 's conclusion is so preposterous that it 's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around .
action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion .
graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle .
unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it .
the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition .
we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again .
the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length .
the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances .
there 's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash .
he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv 's " lou grant " ) , get stuck on a street that 's rapidly turning into a river .
a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers .
after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs .
as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg 's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives .
there is n't any real acting in this film .
christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera .
tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen .
randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing .
morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script .
freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time .
following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that does n't trust nature 's fury as the chief engine of conflict .
as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had .
titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water .
hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible .
thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) .
fortunately , there are only two elements left .

a new entry in the " revisionist history " genre of filmmaking , dick suggests that two not-too-bright teenage girls are the cause of the uncovering of the nation 's biggest presidential scandal .
kirsten dunst and michelle williams star betsy and arlene , who while trying to deliver a fan letter from arlene 's watergate hotel room , accidentally stumble across g . gordon liddy ( played dead-on by harry shearer ) and the infamous break-in .
when they recognize liddy later on during a white house field trip , they are ushered into a conference room , questioned as to what they know , and leave as official presidential dog walkers .
the girls manage to unwittingly uncover every bit of the watergate scandal while performing their duties , but have no clue as to what they are getting involved with .
when they discover that nixon ( another dead-on performance by dan hedaya , who actually favors nixon slightly , unlike anthony hopkins ) has been abusive to checkers , the presidential dog , thanks to the conversations that he always recorded , they quit and become disillusioned .
during a prank phone call the girls make to woodward and bernstein , events are set into motion that eventually lead to the president 's resignation .
this film starts off promisingly with an aged woodward and bernstein arguing with each other on an obvious larry king-type talk show ( featuring a cameo by french stewart ) about revealing the identity of " deep throat " .
from there , we are subjected to bodily function humor and just about every bad " dick " joke one can derive from this type of supposed comedy .
at one point , the girls are having to scream over a high school band playing on the steps of the lincoln memorial .
the band manages to stop right as dunst screams " you have to stop letting dick run your life ! "
much to the horror of everyone standing within earshot .
several other variations on this wordplay surface all throughout the film .
if this movie had been smarter i would have been less likely to fault it 's juvenile bathroom humor , but it 's not .
the film was apparently made for relatively younger people because every major player in the watergate scandal is introduced and shoved down the audience 's throat in the least subtle way possible .
i do n't recall oliver stone 's nixon having to pander to it 's audience , but of course that film was n't a comedy aimed squarely at a 13-20 year-old film going audience .
the only redeeming thing about this movie is it 's remarkable supporting cast .
i wanted to see more of ferrell and mcculloch 's woodward and bernstein .
those two characters are the sole basis for my rating .
i wish they had been given more screen time , but unfortunately , they are only relegated to the final half-hour .
their constant bickering and fighting over trying to get the story are a major highlight , especially mcculloch 's constant thwarting of ferrell 's attempts to gather information from the girls ( who , in the course of the narrative are revealed as deep throat , so named thanks to an ill planned trip to a porno theater by betsy 's brother ) .
the other members of the cast are excellent in their portrayals of their particular characters , but are given nothing to work with .
i 'd like to see the same cast portray these characters in a script more suited towards their comedic abilities .
as for the two leads , dunst and williams can definitely do better .
they come off as what could best be described as romy and michele : the early years in this particular film , a highly dubious distinction at best .
stay through the first half of the end credits though , to see an interesting scene involving dunst and williams suggestively sucking on lollipops emblazoned with the title of the movie .
an excellent idea marred by poor execution , dick could have been a great movie .
less of the juvenile humor and more of the smarter comedy displayed by the woodward and bernstein scenes , could have made this film a wonderful satire of the nixon presidency as seen through the eyes of two naive fifteen year olds .
as it stands though , dick offers nothing but what filmmaker kevin smith so accurately defines as " dick and poopie " jokes .
and that , to me , does not make a funny movie .

in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .
was it " deep " ?
nope .
however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .
it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was " without the comic book uplift " of the indiana jones and superman pictures .
which was true .
if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man 's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .
if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .
some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that " this is batman as batman should be . " ;
mr . travers called it one of the ten best films of the year .
the praise was deserved - from start to finish the film was enthralling , exciting , and superb in every respect .
there was no doubt that there would be a sequel directed by burton .
the result was batman returns which forgets that it wants to be fun within the first five minutes .
the villains ( the hideous penguin and seductive catwoman ) take over , and our epectations are always left unfulfilled - when we wanted the penguin to bite off batman 's nose he simply gets mad , and when we want catwoman to slither over batman 's body she gets pushed off a building .
i admire mr . burton for trying to do more then entertain , but the result is a mess .
nothing works out as planned - it fails both to entertain and to enlighten .
hints are made to the audience that this film could be a blast .
alas , these are only hints .
there are , do n't misunderstand me , several moments of cinematic genuis contained ; catwoman and batman understand eachother perfectly without a word on the subject being said ; christopher lloyd is trapped , by the penguin , within a giant cage ; a small basket is dropped into a large river ; but nothing is drawn together and burton is unable to make the film work on any regular basis .
a weak followup , both career and sequel wise , batman returns is sometimes dazzling , but to often dissapointing .

` bats ' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan .
to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines .
something like the underground worm thriller ` tremors ' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun .
with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , ` bats ' mainly plays it 's premise for straight-arrow horror .
judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move .
the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock 's ` the birds ' , but fails miserably .
done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema .
unfortunately , ` bats ' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong .
the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be .
i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom ` bats ' is aimed toward .
those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats .
these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people .
boy , are these bats ugly .
they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart .
they 've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all .
a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats .
they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it 's sorta hard to do .
the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good .
but no , ` bats ' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers .
the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores .
on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations .
but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude .
even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed .
the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) .
the scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as ` the best in her field ' .
meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition .
her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper 's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in ` jaws ' .
everything revolving around ` bats ' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up .
the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later .
in fact , that may have worked out better in the end .
take one glance at casper 's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you 'll have immediate deja vu - he 's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief .
unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny .
in the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch .
mccabe ` accidentally ' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats .
the entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else .
something like : ` when is the damn movie going to be over ? ?
i just want my money . '
the bats are ugly , i must say .
there 's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery .
only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it 's way too late in the game for a decent recovery .
characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire .
let 's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ?
you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them .
this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind ` bats ' .

" tarzan and the lost city " is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while .
not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid .
unfortunately , it 's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like " heaven 's gate " ( 1980 ) or " ishtar " ( 1987 ) were bad .
instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place .
with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ?
of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984 's " greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes " ) down to the really bad ( 1981 's " tarzan , the ape man " with bo derek ) .
most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps .
therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others .
" greystoke " added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even " tarzan , the ape man " at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek 's bare breasts .
" tarzan and the lost city , " on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue .
the script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come .
comic books have better plots than this .
the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer 's comedy " george of the jungle . "
did n't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ?
the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage .
when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week .
however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa 's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle .
at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man .
once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city .
most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of .
there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from " raiders of the lost ark " ( 1981 ) to " the goonies " ( 1985 ) .
when the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river .
the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality .
for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he does n't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do .
instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival .
of course , one ca n't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is .
not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city .
there is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) .
which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it 's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ?
strictly speaking , " tarzan and the lost city " is n't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien 's laughably stiff performance comes real close .
this movie proves what " starship troopers " only hinted at : he can not act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle .
van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he 's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth .
i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut .
waddington makes a decent villain , although he 's like a charmless version of belloq from " raiders of the lost ark . " as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan .
she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess .
however , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news .
" tarzan and the lost city " is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid .
so , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short .

there 's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact .
i 'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release .
the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes .
deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking .
the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there 's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation 's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .
then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense .
the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there 's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation 's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .
it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail .
how do we know this ?
because we 've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that " the comet is still headed right for us " and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading .
ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie .
successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots .
television is what 's wrong with deep impact .
the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that 's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy .
she thinks it 's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area .
when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps .
" i know you 're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . "
she figures out what 's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet .
upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question .
and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you 're a star .
leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet 's collision course with earth .
and i 'm sure it 's comforting for her to know that , even though the world 's ending in a matter of months , she 's a cable news personality .
so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up .
such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process .
but as anyone who 's seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail .
they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth .
yeah , thanks , nasa .
that 's when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who are n't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years .
they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave .
if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie .
instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town .
the reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location .
and , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks .
i 'm sure it 's comforting to know that , even though the world 's ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives .

after enduring mariah carey 's film debut , glitter , i 'm reminded of a bit from chris rock 's bigger and blacker .
in response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , " you can drive a car with your feet , but that do n't mean it should be done . "
to that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly do n't mean it should be done .
sure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles ' a hard day 's night to the spice girls ' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter .
everything about this complete tripe is ludicrous .
start off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie .
the film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers .
worse yet , everyone 's speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 .
meant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother .
influential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . " lucky 7 " ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star .
in predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie 's on " the roller coaster of superstardom . "
in the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom .
i wo n't give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . .
you 'll figure it out .
the movie screams to be made with camp , and that could 've been fun .
but the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better .
what a mistake .
the brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie 's first music video -- go over like lead balloons .
instead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah 's most dramatic scenes .
which brings us to the performances , of which there 's nothing good that can be said .
mariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face .
she actually looks scared during her one love scene .
but you have to wonder if the writing is n't even worse .
so much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey 's virginal target audience that it 's probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb .
even the characters could n't have been written more absurdly .
they 're all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , " billie , i 'd love to put you in a movie i 'm making , " and the big-time record executive who takes billie 's demo tape and says , " oh , i 'll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . "
everyone in the film is a device , and it 's painful to keep watching just to see another one appear .
to say more would be a waste .
there 's so much wrong with this film .
and , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she 's likely to get .
but , then again , i had to suffer through her movie .

nostalgia for the 70s continues , as we see a revival of one of the decade 's greatest achievements : the marijuana comedy .
however half baked does n't quite run with all its brain cells , and will make you appreciate the questionable talents of cheech and chong all the more .
the plot follows the misadventures of four ne'er-do-well stoners .
there 's the group 's unofficial leader , thurgood ( david chappelle ) , scarface ( guillermo diaz ) , brian ( jim breuer ) , and kenny ( harland williams ) .
kenny gets into trouble , when , while on a munchie run , feeds his snack foods to a diabetic police horse .
when the animal keels over , he finds himself accused of killing a police officer , and facing a $ 1 , 000 , 000 bail .
his friends promise to raise money for a 10 % bail bond , but have no idea how .
that is , until thurgood stumbles upon a stash of pharmaceutical marijuana being tested at the company where he works as a janitor .
soon the three guys are dealing dope to raise funds , while avoiding the cops and rival dealer sampson simpson ( clarence williams iii ) .
for a comedy , the film is pretty humorless .
not that it does n't try . . . it 's
just that the comic setups are obvious and the payoffs nearly all fall flat .
the four leads are nearly all playing the same character .
only williams stands out ( while still performing on the level of his humor-free comedy rocket man ) , but that is because he 's imprisoned throughout most of the film , giving a much needed change of pace ( but mostly swapping one set of obvious gags for another ) .
to help out , the film is packed full of cameos .
steven wright , tommy chong , janeane garofalo , willie nelson , snoop doggy dogg , and jon stewart all make appearances at one point or another .
none of them work , beyond the simple " hey , that 's _____ " level .
in fact the funniest work in the film comes from chappelle .
not as his bland pothead lead , but in his second role , as a pot-obsessed rapper , sir smokealot .
granted , it 's pretty much a one-joke role , and there are n't a ton of laughs . . . but this film needs every one it can scrape up .
to top it off , and in a move contrasting with the tone of the rest of the film , thurgood is given a love interest , mary jane ( rachel true ) .
her role is that of the public service announcement : to inform us why doing drugs ( including pot ) is wrong .
her character seems fabricated merely as a defense to the " your film promotes the use of drugs " camp .
the film would have been better off by sticking with the " rebel " tone it so eagerly tries to claim .
yet , in the end , it does n't really matter .
watching the film clean and sober , you are bound to recognize how truly awful it is .

one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton 's 1925 silent film seven chances .
now i 've never seen seven chances , as i 'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this .
o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company .
he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he 's unwilling to marry her .
his reasons ?
well he 's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently do n't like to be roped or something ( hey , that 's the movie 's explanation . . .
i 'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) .
eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it 's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever .
he essentially says to her , " you win " and hands her a ring .
the audience should now hate this character .
i did .
then the meat of the plot presents itself .
jimmie 's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business .
however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) .
having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a " business proposition " .
the movie was n't half bad by this time , surprisingly .
it was n't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point .
ustinov 's character left a video will , and while he 's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself " what is this , brewster 's millions ? " .
as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook 's character actually says " what is this , brewster 's millions ? "
it was quite surreal .
something happens though during the film 's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive .
up to that point , all of jimmie 's prior girlfriends had turned down his " business proposition " which i felt was good .
at least the film was n't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers .
when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story .
at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride .
these women arrive at jimmie 's location and immediately start bullying him about what he 's looking for in a woman .
when he 's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there 's been a mistake and he wo n't be marrying any of them .
as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off .
this goes on for the rest of the film .
it 's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women .
my groans of disgust could be heard for miles .
the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i 'm still groaning .
the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video .
it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features .
the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film .
apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses .
so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ?
ugh .

recently one night a young director named baz luhrmann could n't sleep .
he tumbled out of bed and moved over to the television where he watched mtv for an hour .
then he moved to his kitchen where he spent the same amount of time eating spoiled food .
then he took down a volume of shakespeare 's work and read it cover to cover - never really paying attention to the words or plot .
and then , as a climax , he took out his video camera and pressed the " on " button .
the result ?
william shakespeare 's romeo + juliet - the worst film ever made and a complete failure .
though , to be fair , an interesting complete failure .
the idea at the film 's core is to make shakespeare appealing to the crowds .
this is done by moving the camera around at a rapid rate so that we ca n't see what is going on .
and filming the dialogue in voice over .
and shooting leonardo dicaprio like a calvin klein model .
and making the frame go still while flashing the character 's name at the bottom .
and filming long tedious action sequences in slow motion .
i mean , man , this is the 90s , dude .
however i 've seen terrible films that are fun to watch .
( examples are batman and robin and the island of doctor moreau .
) that rule does n't apply here .
this is a film that takes itself seriously .
that is it 's major fault .
another problem was pointed out by my friend , alex ( who was singing songs by leonard bernstein throughout .
) ; the original play is a powerful piece of work because the author remained neutral and did n't take sides .
here it 's clear that we are supposed to side with romeo .
( just look at the way they film him .
) from the begining he 's our hero and this does n't work .
and dicaprio 's awful performance does n't help .
luhrmann never decides if he wants to entertain us or enlighten us .
the result is a mess .
you can feel him striving to be something he is n't .
he tries to pull of a mix in which drag queens are filmed from purposefully arty angles .
he tries very hard .
key word : tries .
" oh look , he 's filming above water action from below .
pretty .
what does it represent ? "
why do people do ugly things ?
i scrambled away from my tv set feeling guilty as if i could never read the play again and keep a straight face .

disconnect the phone line .
do n't accept the charges .
do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy ` hanging up ' .
i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and ` hanging up ' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so .
the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as ` sleepless in seattle ' and ` unsung heroes ' .
meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer 's disease .
while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery .
` hanging up ' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you do n't have the option of doing as the title suggests .
for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development .
this is an annoying and ineffective device .
cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters ' issues and problems .
if ` hanging up ' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story .
granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film .
but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck .
the most outrageous strategy in ` hanging up ' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale .
we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father 's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career .
georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . .
` georgia ' .
maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog .
ryan 's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of ` hanging up ' .
kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in ` friends ' , is totally wasted .
ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle .
her frenzy is apparent .
for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles .
the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character 's situation , seems more depressing than amusing .
even so , the peak form of humor in ` hanging up ' is represented by some of matthau 's nasty quips and ryan 's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill .
that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film .
my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour .
but really , it 's no mystery .
the predictable , melodramatic filth that is ` hanging up ' is certainly not the fault of these actresses .
pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations .
it 's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but ` hanging up ' should have at least been enjoyable .
uh-uh .
it 's a wrong number from the beginning .

arye cross and courteney cox star as a pair of bostonians who meet in a bar , go to the movies , fall in love , move in together , etc .
review = = = = = =
well , if you have n't seen when harry met sally or he said , she said , or if you do n't watch love & war on television , you might think this is the most inventive film to come along in ages .
however , if you 've seen any of these , than you have seen most of this film .
this of course does n't mean its bad .
some of it is amusing , but overall , i just had to ask what 's the point ?
arye cross is the stereotypical single male who falls in love .
kevin pollack is the stereotypical female-fearing best friend who make a lot of rather sexist and vulgar jokes , most if which were n't very funny .
couteney cox is the stereotypical career-minded woman who falls in love .
julie brown is the stereotypical bizarre best friend of said woman .
( notice the frequent use of the word stereotypical .
this film uses a lot of formula , the plot is basically known from the opening credits . )
so what is good about the movie ?
well as i said there are a few amusing moments .
surprisingly , julie brown , who i usually find just plain goofy , was the best thing in the film .
also there are several very funny sequences involving analysis of the human mating ritual .
gee , this is really short .
not much to say about the film really .
it is just kind of there .
watching it on video might not be a complete waste of time , but i would n't recommend hiring a baby sitter or spending a lot of money to see it at the theatre .

these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes .
but , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers .
sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south .
the way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place .
one of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade .
in order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 .
seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america .
this time , however , third time was n't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure .
eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback .
eddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop .
the routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley 's boss .
determined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) .
when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles .
there , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring .
ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different .
in this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply does n't work .
screenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys .
since foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile .
unfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children .
nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath .
unlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply ca n't balance the comedy with " regular " action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects .
action scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat .
to make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) .
in the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there are n't any plans for beverly hills iv .

sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and " pushing tin " certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he 's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people .
sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has " hip comedy " written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing " you have to be joking " situations .
etc .
in " pushing tin , " thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack do n't have an earthly .
from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , " quirky " credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley 's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for " the full monty , " let alone won it .
but i , for one , was n't ready to walk just yet .
so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger 's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game .
hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick " the zone " falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz .
of course .
until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone 's finite air space .
boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins .
it does n't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat 's whisker of each other .
oh no .
there are some broken hoop dreams , some wan na-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ?
director mike newell ( " four weddings and a funeral " ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that 's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia does n't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before .
the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe .
they 'll make you frown in disbelief .
they 'll have you constantly looking at your watch .
but wait !
there 's still 100 minutes to go ! !
the film 's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes .
this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( " oscar and lucinda " ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( " elizabeth " ) .
but she 's not enough to save the picture .
thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke .
jolie ( as russell 's knock 'em dead wife ) is n't bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything .
cusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced .
in the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases .
but it 's too little too late .
a fine cast aside , " pushing tin " is nothing more than an embarrassment .

call it a road trip for the walking wounded .
stellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it 's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence .
yet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama .
playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late .
that 's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) .
they have n't spoken in years , and would n't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it were n't for kaisa 's mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer .
in a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live .
( only in the movies , right ? )
too blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa .
loathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he is n't muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be .
despite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple has n't fallen very far from the tree .
kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper .
ai n't they a pair ?
unable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative .
by the time they reach the hospital , it 's time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they 're also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe .
this revelation exists purely for its own sake .
aberdeen does n't know where else to go .
weak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa .
if lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) .
headey 's too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance .
if she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she 'd figure out that doing less can reveal so much more .
it 's worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter 's captivating signs & wonders .
it 's not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they 're not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) .
the differences in the way their characters were presented is significant .
in aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed .
despite skarsg ? rd 's solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow .
there 's genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity .
nossiter 's film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain .
if signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it 's willing to stretch beyond what we 've come to expect from traditional drama .
aberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies .
when did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ?
the depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan 's trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin 's hollywood mogul pronounces , " all of life 's riddles are answered in the movies ! "
even foreign films are taking that advice to heart .

an attempt at florida film noir , palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels .
it 's slow moving , uninvolving , and plain just uninteresting .
harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is an ex-newspaper man , just out of jail after being framed for a crime .
his luck has n't been the best , but things are looking up when a mysterious woman , rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , approaches him with a proposition .
she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter , odette ( chloe sevigny ) , pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get $ 500 , 000 out of her stingy , but rich , husband felix ( rolf hoppe ) .
at first , all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone , and to collect the money ( of which he gets to keep 10 % ) .
but , as the deed is carried out , things are not what they seem , and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm .
palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film , but the effect never quite comes together .
it 's got the sultry florida heat , seductive women , and even curvier plot twists , but the whole thing smells of paint-by-numbers .
sure , the right ingredients are there , but the end result is much too artificial .
a lot of the problems lie with the script , which , though providing some genuine surprises , is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations .
even the plot twists do n't seem to flow well with the rest of the story .
some of them , for example , come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist ( for example : harry 's spontaneous job offer , or the whole typewriter situation ) .
the characters are mostly lifeless , played to type , but not much more .
woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick-headedness that it 's hard to even picture him as an ex-journalist .
elisabeth shue vamps it up , but does n't add anything special to the role .
chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance , trying to be a sexy 17-year old , but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth .
some of the supporting cast ( notably gina gershon and michael rapaport ) give stronger , but , in the end , meaningless performances .
and to top it off , the pacing of the film is much too slow .
as the movie grinds to a halt , you 're given too much time to wonder why you 're wasting it watching palmetto .
if you 're in the mood for this type of movie , you 'd be much better off going out and renting some classic film noir .

everything in the phantom you have seen many times before and there is nothing new presented here .
wincer displays absolutely no skill in setting up an exciting action sequence .
billy zane is wooden as the hero .
kristy swanson is given very little to do , and does very little with it .
treat williams , looking like rhett butler but sounding like mickey mouse , is one of the worst villains i have ever seen in a movie .
only catherine zeta jones , as one of williams cohorts turns in a good performance .
she has energy and spunk , which the movie needed much more of .
oh yeah , the phantom also has a secret identity but this is so poorly played out you wo n't even care .
about the only things i can recommend are a good performance by jones , and some colorful scenery .
however , if youre looking for a fun family movie , go watch the underrated flipper .
this is not a good movie .

once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero .
the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability .
some of these excursions were fun .
but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action .
and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ?
i 'll explain .
knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong .
marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) .
they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business .
i 'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one .
i 'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i 'll issue a warning anyhow .
tommy is really working with the cia .
his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons .
he even stoops so low to put them into children 's toys .
if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off .
if you think that this ridiculous set-up could n't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea .
knock off sucks .
it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares .
it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star .
the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe .
director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot .
i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous .
the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired .
it all sounds very cool .
trust me , it is n't .
as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible .
sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease .
he looks like he 's doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired .
i hate to say it , but perhaps it 's time for mr . van damme to give up his day job .
it 's really a test of endurance watching knock off .
i suppose there 's some enjoyment derived from schneider 's character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film 's better moments .
and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ?
hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter .
knock off does n't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme 's others .
no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking .
and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much .
note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 .

upon first viewing of this movie , the phrases " been there " and " done that " come quickly to mind .
spy hard manages to steal almost every joke from the zucker brothers films , the most popular of which are airplane and the naked gun series .
stealing stuff can be profitable in this industry , but only when you steal the right stuff .
what little plot there is involves dick steele , aka .
agent wd-40 ( leslie nielsen ) trying to save the world from an almost deranged madman played by andy griffith .
along the way to it goal ( goal ? ) , the film manages to spoof mainly the james bond type films , but also manages to hit on films such as home alone and sister act .
the trick about spoofing is that you have to actually be funny , or at the least , satirical .
spy hard achieves neither , as it borrows all of the wrong elements from the superior zucker brothers films .
the " dick , the world is in danger .
what is it ?
well , it 's a big roundish ball floating in space around the sun . .
( i 'm paraphrasing ) " type of exchange is used at least four times in the opening ten minutes of the film , each time getting progressively less funny .
what they should have stolen were the background sight gags which were so effective in the zucker brother 's films while writing their own dialogue .
director rick friedberg focuses more on the mug shots of his actors ( especially nielsen , who can do this quite well ) than on the delivery and context of their lines , much of the time cutting the punchline short .
the whole film seems to be in a race with itself to be over , as is evident in the final sequence , where there is no comedic denouement after the climax .
as was usual in the zucker brothers films and in spy hard , the end credits tend to replace this by being out of context .
one of the more amusing was , " captain of the enterprise . . . . . . james
t . kirk " .
overall , i thought this was a very weak effort .
while all of the right films to spoof were chosen , they used none of the right spoofing methods .
next time they should " spy " a little bit harder .
* * * * = excellent .
one of a kind .
must see .
* * * = entertaining .
worth the price of admission .
* * = fair .
nothing much special .
* = what were they thinking ? ?

this is the last carry on film with its almost intact regular cast and it is the swansong of hattie jacques and sid james .
dick turpin ( sid james ) and his gang which includes harriett/harry ( barbara windsor ) and tom " doc " scholl ( peter butterworth ) , terrorise the countryside by staging highway robberies : " stand and deliver ! "
owing to the increased occurrence of turpin 's robberies , captain desmond fancey of the bow street runners ( kenneth williams ) and his sidekick sergeant jock strapp ( jack douglas ) visit turpin 's area of influence to bring him to justice .
they are under the express orders of sir roger daley ( bernard bresslaw ) .
their intellect does not count for much and when they increasingly become suspicious of reverend flasher aka dick turpin ( sid james ) , whom they confided in earlier , they still can not believe that the rector has any part in these robberies .
however , once they catch harriett and put her in jail , and sir roger daley takes complete charge , it seems that there is no hope for dick turpin .
then again , sir roger has assigned the dimwits fancey and jock strapp aswell as the old dithering constable ( kenneth connor ) to keep an eye on their prisoner !
there is no doubt that this is a 'sid james ' carry on movie .
he excels in double roles ( as in 'carry on- do n't lose your head ' ) and his performance as flasher and turpin is hilarious .
barbara windsor is also funny as harriett the sex mad housemaid and member of the gang , and hattie jacques ' small but effective role as the rector 's housekeeper martha hoggett is played to perfection .
jack douglas plays a milder version of his excruciatingly annoying on-screen persona and kenneth williams is given a rather mundane part .
peter butterworth is not allowed to shine in his boring performance as tom , and bernard bresslaw 's character appears only briefly in the film .
the only notable performance from the support cast comes from joan sims as madame desiree , who is travelling around the country escorting her starlets the 'birds of paradise ' and sporting a fake french accent .
when her girls and her are robbed by turpin , she is determined to catch him and helps the reverend to find the culprit !
a carry on by the numbers , this movie is only notable for the great performance by sid james in his last carry on movie .
the jokes are bluer , the script is poorer ( it is the last script written by talbot rothwell ) , but the music is a marked improvement .
although nearly all the regulars appear , they seem to be just going through the motions .
none of the high spirits of the earlier films are apparent here .
just a selection of crude jokes and repititive double-entendres .

the comet-disaster flick is a disaster alright .
directed by tony scott ( top gun ) , it tells the story about an asteroid the size of texas caught on a collision course with earth .
and you thought that dinky little comet in deep impact was trouble .
jeez .
after a great opening , in which an american spaceship , plus the city of new york , are completely destroyed by a comet shower , nasa detects the said asteroid and go into a frenzy .
they hire the world 's best oil driller ( bruce willis ) , and send him and his crew up into space to fix our globel problem .
that 's like sending a mouse into a cat carrier , is n't it ?
the action in armageddon are so over the top , nonstop , and too ludicrous for words , i had to sigh and hit my head with my notebook a couple of times .
i was not alone .
plus , to see a wonderful actor like billy bob thornton is a film like armageddon is a waste of the actor 's talents .
the film is just a reel to show off a bunch of snazzy fx shots .
the only real reason for making this film was to somehow out-perform deep impact .
producer jerry bruckheimer fails with armageddon .

i know it 's hated amongst the superman faithful who dismiss it as nothing more than a vehicle for richard pryor , but i still think it 's a worthy addition to the man of steel franchise .
supergirl , a spin-off film of sorts from the series ' same producers ( alexander and ilya salkind ) , does n't even rival superman iii in terms of quality , let alone superman or superman ii .
supergirl lost me from the opening scenes and went steadily downhill for the rest of its two hour plus running time .
as the film begins we see the residents of argo city , a commune like place consisting of refugees from krypton which resides in " inner space " , go about their daily lives .
ok . . .
what ?
so these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ?
were they living there before krypton exploded ?
how do you get to " inner space " ?
this whole " inner space " notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world .
how do they know where superman went ?
how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ?
these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me .
argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron .
one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o ' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman 's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art .
kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of " whatever " that protects the city .
in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . .
in three days time , or something .
kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world .
the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) .
selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination .
selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she 's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) .
supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives .
ok . . .
huh ?
why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ?
attention movie : explain yourself !
i 'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much .
i ca n't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to .
knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically " wills " herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school .
she 's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ?
lois lane 's sister , lucy .
ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we 're getting really contrived now .
what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . .
complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) .
best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks .
at this point i 'm rapidly wondering why i 'm bothering with this nonsense .
there is some credit to give to the film however .
one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an " evil " bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its " prey " is very well done .
also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools .
hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara 's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film 's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some " menacing " bumper cars ) .
then there were numerous little things that bothered me .
the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . .
it 's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires .
instead of having her look like she 's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be " graceful " , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers .
also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ?
a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a " wacky " demise .
there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye 's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) .
finally , just one word : monsters .
faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he 's entertaining and when dunaway does it she 's annoying ( her character actually says the line " seize them ! "
at one point ) .
dunaway 's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty 's otis character from the first two superman movies .
helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she 's written to be , as she 's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable .
believability aside though , it 's still annoying .
now despite all this negativity ( and i 'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd !
they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . .
yet i 'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) .
the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters .
the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory .
extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and " special project consultant " scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries .
the transfer on this international version is incredible . . .
you 'd think you were watching a new release .
images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts .
only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just is n't much that can be done about that ( unless you 're obsessive like george lucas ) .
the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you 'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams ' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films ' golan-globus production ) .
the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries .
bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there 's no dead air on the track .
bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation .
although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he does n't get that response .
we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the " almost " appearance in the film by christopher reeve .
great detail is given about superman 's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out .
as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission .
for the sake of brevity , i wo n't even get into that one .
szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy " whimsical fantasy " nonsense .
bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office .
again , for the sake of brevity , i wo n't even get into that one .
anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set .
disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release .
disc two features the never before seen director 's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long .
the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which do n't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole 's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) .
the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film wo n't care .
one question though . . .
should n't the director 's commentary be on the director 's cut of the film ?
i 'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd .
i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it .
so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect .
i knew the film was n't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc .
as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong .
come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . .
so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started .
at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city .
ugh , i give up .
i 'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs .
supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie .

capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith 's films gets their own movie .
the gags are sporadically funny .
it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes .
the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team .
the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film .
sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching .
this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night .
( and it turns out he had very good reasons . )
, low 0 ( -4 to + 4 )
a film needs a plot .
it needs characters for empathy value .
it needs a story and an emotional center .
if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are .
kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy .
with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp .
peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled .
but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith 's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it .
his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience .
jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes .
how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call .
for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny .
there was not enough cleverness or variety .
it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay .
penis jokes work only so many times .
showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags .
they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico .
jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners .
as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts .
in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads .
jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks .
this leaves them at loose ends .
they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie .
they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash .
so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way .
the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood
the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny .
silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his .
this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have .
jay has to be the comic .
he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive .
the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny .
he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair .
so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team .
their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before .
like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie .
certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving .
they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat .
it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content .
the film does not offer much to an adult audience .
i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits .
the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that 's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is .
last year 's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year 's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory .
in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer .
whatever uniqueness the original might 've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller .
julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion .
julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) .
will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics .
unfortunately , things are n't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook .
it 's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending .
there 's not much that 's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it 's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel .
for die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer .
the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot is n't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing .
the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments .
much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point .
the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem .
and , whereas the killer 's identity might 've been a question in the first movie , it 's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically .
three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as " the killer . "
they 're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show .
and so , in the end , it 's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast .
god help us .

ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .
these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .
if it 's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .
hackers is guilty of all of these crimes .
to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you ca n't take it anymore .
those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled " goofs " .
this is the section for mistakes in the movies .
well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : " generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology " .
and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct .
the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking .
more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller .
miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers .
the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems .
he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old .
the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer .
dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi .
oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film .
really , i ca n't think of much more to say about the film 's plot aside from what i 've said .
it 's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi .
thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do .
this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list .
to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film .
if you 're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers .
although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users .
hopefully , this film did n't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time .

in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama , " glory , " but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994 's " legends of the fall , " and 1996 's " courage under fire . "
those two films were n't bad , just not very good , but with zwick 's latest film , " the siege , " he has finally made one .
" the siege , " is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city .
investigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it .
later , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more .
they soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist .
there are some movies that simply do n't need to be made , and , " the siege " may very well be one of them .
oh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a " meaningful " action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , " die hard , " which also starred bruce willis .
this time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax .
whatever points , " the siege , " earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place .
the role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , " john caprenter 's vampires , " by placing them all in the category of " bad guys . "
" the siege , " contains three fine actors---washington , bening , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development .
bening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again , he has no real character .
by the climax of , " the siege , " with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called " message " of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , " on deadly ground , " in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment .
" the siege " is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay .

making your first feature film ai n't easy .
assemble a decent , if not , strong cast , as writer/director robert moresco has done with one eyed king , and you 're already ahead of the game .
but rehash old plot lines , tired dialogue , and standard clich ? s , and a well-intentioned effort such as this one could jeopardize your chance at a second feature film .
how many more movies do we need about a rough neighborhood full of lifelong friends hopelessly turned to crime or worse ?
the enormous catalog of such movies might dissuade a filmmaker from making yet another , but here we have it .
again .
five irish kids in nyc 's hell 's kitchen make an overemotional pact over some stolen rings on an anonymous rooftop .
with teary music .
and slow motion .
in the film 's first scene .
the kids grow up to be fairly worthless adults , unable or unwilling to make their way out of the heat of the kitchen .
leading the clueless pack is william baldwin as a good-hearted guy who watches out for his buddies and is in tight with local mob head armand assante .
i 'd like to say that his character gets involved over his head in some sort of blah , blah , blah , but all we seem to get are little tastes of possible plot points .
he 's concerned about buddy jason gedrick 's heroin abuse .
he sticks up for jim breuer after he impregnates baldwin 's character 's sister .
he looks into who might be pushing the most moronic-looking counterfeit cash ever made ( a genuinely funny touch ) .
but none of this ever really amounts to anything .
it seems that moresco 's greater concern is to provide that intangible " slice of life " , that flavor of the neighborhood that everyone 's been trying to evoke since scorsese 's early work .
so , we get the drunk guys , hugging and singing together at the local bar , to prove to us that they really love each other .
( do people actually do this ! ? )
we get a lot of tough street talk -- usually mumbled for effect -- and a whole lot of the f-word , whether it sounds like it fits or not .
we also get a handful of good actors in small roles that seem to lack purpose .
bruno kirby , chazz palminteri , you know , guys you 've seen in movies just like this one before .
assante is intelligent casting as the man that everyone fears , and baldwin 's performance is adequate , but most of the rest of the cast jump into the tough guy persona so thoroughly that it 's almost funny .
moresco , a theater guy and sometimes tv writer ( including the series falcone ) , obviously labored over this one as anyone might a first child , but the content is probably too personal .
as a result , the movie 's style is heavy-handed , in need of a considerable amount of toning down .
nearly every time an action by the grown up gang recalls something they did as kids , moresco reminds us -- boy does he remind us .
with slow dissolves to the earlier scene , running in slow motion , complete with dialogue from the present , just in case we do n't comprehend the link to the past .
moresco needs to either trust his audience 's intelligence , or have more faith in his own presentation rather than beat us over the head with it .
his next project should have a little more personal distance , and a lot more subtlety .
if he actually gets that chance .
reviewed as part of our 2001 boston film festival coverage ( feature story coming soon ) .

this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i 've had for a while .
with this film , plus ` showgirls ' and ` basic instinct ' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors .
his celebrated film ` total recall ' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws .
obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in ` starship ' seemed fake .
but not everything bad in the film was the director 's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors .
it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) .
casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school .
no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first .
while ` total ' was written well , ` starship ' is purely pathetic .
all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you 're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) .
as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours .
half of the film was a bad episode of ` beverly hills 90210 ' ( dina meyer was in " beverly hills " ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images .
the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects .
there were n't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around .
i wonder what the insects eat , if there 's nothing but them on the planets ?
there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended .
this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who ca n't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality .
but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind .
the pointless plot begins when johnny 's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth .
johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents .
but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which is n't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose .
and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid .
anyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league .
dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also .
they then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat .
and guess what ?
that 's about as complex as it gets .
oh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it .
he 's my fifth nom for a razzie .
the troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act .
naturally , they win , or sort of half-win .
of course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs .
the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ?
is n't it also amazing that earthlings have n't invented better hand-held weapons by then ?
the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero .
well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying ` zulu ' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) .

what a contrast !
in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly .
i 'm not sure you could get two more different movies .
while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it .
this is one interesting movie .
it 's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty .
there 's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men .
hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him .
his big question is : does it all pertain to him ?
and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ?
" it " means everything : television , friends , events that happen .
i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what 's it all about ?
this is not a movie for answers .
donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they 're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions .
that 's what makes this movie stay on your mind .
these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time .
even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do .
the performances are all superb in hurlyburly .
i have n't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i ca n't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this .
eddie is n't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable .
i do n't want to be his friend but i 'd like to help him .
chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person .
i 'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend .
everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real .
it 's a nasty world ; it 's a sexist world .
unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man 's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men .
i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing .
first , it 's depressing that such a world exists .
a large part of hurlyburly 's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings .
sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background .
second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men 's world .
where are the stories about women 's world ?
not the soap operas and the " chick flicks " that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men .
hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts .
it 's very talkative , intelligent and static .
while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they 're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing .
not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas .
not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience .
all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen .
it also means that you have to pay attention .

i should have known , damn it , i should have known .
ewan mcgregor - codename : " eye " - is pointing a high-tech rifle-ly gadget at a fat , bald business-oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street .
we get the requisite electro-green through-the-sight view .
we the audience , seeing a high tech rifle-ly gadget , of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target , but instead , he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy , low-quality photographs , which eye then proceeds to fax and e-mail to everyone in his target 's office .
all right , so thirty seconds in , i was slightly befuddled by this seemingly pointless rifle/camera , but i was still open minded . . .
maybe there 's a really good reason for it .
i 've got reason to believe , you see - i admire a lot of ewan mcgregor 's previous work . . .
and he 's obi wan ke- friggin-nobi for god 's sake .
and director stephan elliot 's last movie priscilla , queen of the desert was a quirky little delight .
there 's some genuine talent involved here .
i think at the twenty minute mark , there was still a spark of hope in my heart .
eye has been assigned to investigate the leader of his organization 's son ( i still have no idea what this organization was - british intelligence ?
national spy ring ?
private investigation ? ) , who is apparently stealing from his trust fund .
he has received his assignment from k . d .
lang , through an elaborate and expensive teleconferencing briefcase .
when eye tracks his target to an expensive- looking secluded house , he witnesses a mysterious and beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) take a knife out and proceed to stab the poor bastard .
ok , that 's odd , i think to myself , this could be interesting .
then she starts to cry , and through her tears exclaims " merry christmas , dad ! "
for the first time .
so begins our tale of obsession . . .
or . . . something .
the rest of the movie involves ewan mcgregor 's eye character following ashley judd around to every corner of the united states , totally and completely obsessed by this woman from afar .
throughout his entire professional life , he has been a voyeur ; so when he falls for someone , the only way he can handle it is to watch and drool through telescopes and cameras .
fine , that 's a lovely premise , i suppose .
but gosh darn it , if you 're going to go there , you better have some sort of explanation .
and that 's precisely where this film fails .
this is the kind of movie that pisses me off .
it 's an abortion , a collection of half-formed and wasted ideas that amounts to absolutely nothing in the end .
it pretends it is something that it is not - a surreal and deep psychological character study wrapped in a high-tech thriller .
here , the filmmakers have confused " surreal " and " deep " with " vaguely unclear " and " crammed full of insultingly obvious metaphors . "
i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in " love " with this woman who changes wigs and kills people .
the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense .
explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye 's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he should n't leave ms . judd .
explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : " beauty is in the eye of the beholder . "
whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed .
that 's as deep as it gets , folks .
there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib .
there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .
my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers ' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley 's awfully played dirty desert vagrant # 1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot .
each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .
the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .
any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed .
bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass .
ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .
jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . .
cut to random guy with eye patch . . .
iguana out of focus . . .
iguana comes into focus .
wow , man .
when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me .
there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story .
and i would n't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director 's cut . . .
not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .
the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .
some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i did n't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .
someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , " shut the hell up ! " , but it was a lot funnier when we thought he was talking to the screen .

annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) , a widow who struggles to raise her children in a small town in georgia is asked for help by local authorities in solving the case of a missing woman .
annie is something of a psychic , she has involuntary bouts with the supernatural where she can see the past and the future and physically feel the actions happenning to her she envisions .
her " gift " leads to the arrest of a nasty wife beater who may or may not have killed the pretty rich girl found in the swamp on his property .
in an ultra conservative backwoods town will her testimony based on her psychic visions hold up in court ?
do they even have the right man ?
what 's good about it :
aside from keanu reeves giving one of the best performances of his career as the loathable redneck donnie barksdale , there is little else going for the film .
what 's not so good about it :
lame , unoriginal screenplay .
predictable ending .
suspense scenes that are just plain boring .
ridicously trite characterization makes the entire south out to be ingnorant , hateful goobers .
relentless in its emotional sensationaliztion .
overall critique :
" the gift " is one of those movies that makes you wonder where you 've seen this story before .
it 's a collection of every cliche and stereotype of the south ever made , and coming from a yankee like me who dislikes the south that 's really saying something .
for an established , talented director sam raimi is unable to provide any kind of originality to this film .
it 's predictable from the first scene , the screenplay is written like a rip-off of a photocopied bootlegged play .
you know that as nasty as the murder suspect is he did n't actually do it .
it 's no surprise either who the real villain turns out to be and what their motive was .
sigh , how trite .
for a supernatural thriller this is neither scary nor intense because it 's so cliche .
" the gift " is basically a glorified b-movie .

capsule : annoyingly unentertaining , obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie .
presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock .
i 've seen this movie already , i said , as i looked at the box art .
no , i have n't even seen a trailer for the movie ; i do n't even know what it 's about , but i can look at the way they 're promoting it , and i know i 've seen it already .
i thought : it 's about these two cops .
and they 're buddies , sort of .
they 're at each other 's throats a lot , but they really do like each other .
and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they 're hot-shots .
and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship .
and one day they 're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying .
and the bad guy is a drug lord .
and there 's a witness , and she 's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way .
and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down .
i only missed the bit about the badges .
the rest i got dead-on .
and i had n't even left the video store yet .
the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence , and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo .
smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds .
this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence 's " not getting any " , and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house , thinking his partner is now his wife 's " back door man " .
not funny ; tiresome .
bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence .
will smith is a natural , and i 'm happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . .
and men in black .
he 's funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself .
martin lawrence is a different story ; he 's so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial .
movies like this are not about originality .
i know this .
they are about style and energy and synergy between actors .
i know this , too .
and yet , while watching bad boys , which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography , i felt fed up .
i 'd seen con air , which despite being completely implausible , was still great fun , because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix .
bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong , too , clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified .
i could write this movie .
you could write this movie .
many people have .
many people will continue to write this movie , over and over again .
other people will buy it from them , and make it , and we will pay money to see it .
more the fools we all .
in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly , phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange .
one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other .
the same could be said about this movie .
i have the sinking feeling we 're going to see it again .
soon .

i never understood what the clich ? " hell on earth " truly meant until very recently .
i 've just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as " hell on earth " .
after all , i 've never been to war , i 've never been the victim of any violent crime , i 've never really been broken hearted , and i 've never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was " hell on earth "
then i saw cruel intentions .
in a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios .
the very first thing i 'd do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail .
but it would n't just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation .
i 'd have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity .
now you 're probably thinking to yourself : " is this really how bad cruel intentions is ? "
the answer is no .
it 's actually much worse .
watching the cast of this motion picture atrocity try to act their way through roger kumble 's awfully written script is probably a lot like stabbing yourself in the arm with a chainsaw and then pouring salt on the open wound .
and then pouring acid on the salt .
i do n't know if kumble was trying to evoke comedy or tragedy out of his opening scene where marci greenbaum ( tara reid ) whines about having nude photos of her posted on the internet , but the only emotion i felt was sheer boredom .
from that opening scene , where boring actor ryan phillippe tries to seduce tv actress swoosie kurtz , to the conclusion which i do n't remember because i had practically fallen asleep ; cruel intentions is truly " hell on earth , " right up there with war and tax audits .

mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla .
his entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have .
joe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars .
during this scene , i turned to my friend and said , " wow .
that 's some ape . "
joe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla .
he runs around the fields , chasing cars and people .
he picks things up and stares at them pensively .
he breaks things on accident , because he 's just too big to avoid clumsiness .
joe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes .
as a character , he does n't quite register .
and the story he 's been put in is as limp as they come .
the words " family entertainment " have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart .
the picture is a remake of the 1949 film .
it 's mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters .
the main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas .
as a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife .
specifically , she 's out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood .
soon , zoologist gregg o'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill 's mother .
so , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers .
in addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) .
and , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill 's mother .
jill , of course , does n't recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother .
this is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film .
the movie is n't really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla .
but the story is really dumb , there are n't any characters , and the film is n't satisfying on any level beyond its visuals .
the movie also has bad dialogue .
if a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it 's only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like " joe is n't happy ! "
and " joe is n't safe here ! "
" we need to get joe out of here ! "
" joe is way too big for that cage ! "
i do n't know if these phrases are word for word , but they 're close .
as i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) .
paxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them .
sadly , mighty joe young wastes them both .
there are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes .
it 's certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares .
but adults in the audience are n't likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla .
a big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla .
nobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla .

libby parsons ( ashley judd ) has the perfect little life -- a rich husband , a cute son , and a house on the ocean -- but when her husband nick ( bruce greenwood ) takes her sailing , she awakes to find him gone and her hands covered with blood .
just as she makes it to the deck and picks up the bloody knife lying there , the coast guard arrives in response to a distress call her vanished husband sent .
she 's convicted of his murder , of course , and leaves her son matty ( benjamin weir ) with her best friend ( annabeth gish ) .
time passes , and the friend disappears with matty .
during their last phone conversation libby hears matty yell " daddy ! "
and realizes that her husband is still alive .
libby serves six years , growing harder and driven by the desire to kill nick ( based on the theory that because of the " double jeopardy " amendment she can off him with impunity ) .
when she gets parole , she 's sent to a halfway house run by travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) , a former law professor who ruined his life with a drunk driving accident .
after a little breaking and entering and some destruction of property , libby jumps parole and lams it across the country looking for nick and matty .
travis pursues , naturally .
" double jeopardy " is a watered-down version of " the fugitive , " with jones sleep-walking through his well-worn pursuer persona .
although libby never leaps from a bus that collides with a train , she manages to get into a few nail-biters -- chased down the beach by a jeep , chained to a car that plunges into the ocean , sealed in a coffin -- that add some much needed thrills to an anemic , slow-moving script .
character development is thin .
travis ' intriguing backstory is mentioned a couple times but has no effect on the story .
( i think they only made him a former law professor so that he could verify the double-jeopardy theory when libby gets the drop on nick .
it 's a long way to go for one line ) .
there 's considerable sexual tension between travis and libby ( hey , there 's something " the fugitive " did n't have ! ) , but it never goes anywhere .
libby is a tv-movie everywoman , but judd 's intense performance draws us in and makes us forget that her character has no distinguishing characteristics .
this is judd 's most prominent role to date , and she proves that she can light up the screen .
let 's hope hollywood gives her more to work with next time around .
the quality of director bruce beresford 's movies seems to depend on luck .
when he has a good script and a strong cast , he turns out oscar-caliber work like " 'breaker ' morant , " " driving miss daisy , " and " tender mercies . "
when he does n't .
.
.
we get " double jeopardy . "
screenwriters david weisberg and douglas cook previously collaborated on " the rock , " a script which probably benefited from the numerous uncredited rewrites .
bottom line : ashley judd tries hard but ca n't save this predictable bore .

one of the most respected names in american independent filmmaking is john sayles .
he has built a strong reputation with films like matewan and the secret of roan inish , and one of his best was his last film , lone star .
after sayles gave us this complex and unconventional look at ethnic tensions on the us-mexico border , expectation ran high for his next film .
unfortunately , his men with guns is not the film anyone was hoping for .
we are essentially told in the first reel where the film is going to go and what it is going to do .
then the film does exactly what it promised , a painful as that is .
the plot of men with guns can be summarized " in a central or south american country things are really bad for everybody in the mountains where the army clashes with the guerrillas .
dr . fuentes did not believe how bad things were so he went .
and he found out again and again and again . "
of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell .
a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians .
but the film talks down to the viewer .
dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country .
he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios .
fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service .
then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy .
in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others .
the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be .
fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general .
the results are little different than one would expect .
dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive .
even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains .
but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was .
sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians .
the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences .
federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos .
damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter .
mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer .

okay , bear with me y'all , cause first off i have to get this off my chest :
what the hell is up with that damn crab ? ? ?
whew . okay .
cause that same clip shown over and over again was beginning to get on my nerves towards the end , as cute as the crab maybe .
even i know that you need more footage than * that * .
and that was n't the only thing getting on my nerves .
the cutesy gimmicks , saccharine sweet score / soundtrack and the pretty young faces of sarah michelle gellar ( as amanda ) and sean patrick flannery ( as tom ) might have held some appeal during , oh , say the first 10 minutes of the movie .
at first the movie moves along at a quick , interesting pace .
it is speedily established that something magical is about to happen to amanda when she encounters a totally random fairy godfather type person on the street , whose aforementioned crab follows her everywhere and just * does n't * die .
a ridiculous concept , yes , but at this point i 'm willing to accept it because i 'm willing to accept that this is how amanda 's life is changed , how her powers are received .
later on , the movie ca n't seem to decide whether these powers come from this fairy godfather or from amanda falling in with tom .
and this is why the clips of the crab were annoying ; they were n't just repetitive , they were out of place and unnecessary .
the plot stumbles along at an uneven speed , sometimes dwelling too long on a particular development ( amanda suddenly becoming a great chef , her falling in love with tom , etc . ) , sometimes moving on too quickly for its own good .
some places the plot just does n't make sense , sometimes it 's way too contrived ( the crab bit , for example ) , and sometimes too corny ( peaches emitting dry ice .
ca n't beat that ) .
all in all the plot seemed fragmented , unconnected .
not romantic at all , and only funny in some places .
so , okay , do the magic powers come from the crab ?
or the fairy godfather ?
she can * float * now too ?
and all of a sudden , instead of just making dry ice come out of peaches , she can put her emotions into her food ?
tom all of a sudden just accepts amanda 's " witchcraft " in the end ?
would people really dine in a restaurant that resembles life after death in tupac 's video ?
what the hell is up with that damn crab ?
it is unfortunate , because i liked the basic premise of the movie , until it became too fantastical and tiresome .
the film seemed to skirt around a serious theme or at least * a * theme for a while , but towards the end it resolved to show us long flashback clips and 5 minutes of people crying at their tables .
the humor was good in some places ( nolan gets the funniest bits , including that incomprehensible , totally random thing with the dolls ) .
gellar and flannery are qualified actors , and gellar has a particular charm , but i much prefer her playing the saucy buffy ( or even annette in the upcoming " cruel intentions " ) than this sorry excuse for a character .
it 's almost funny sometimes to see these two trying so hard to make the dialogue sound better than it is , or trying to make the relationship seem more plausible .
the supporting character nolan was a highlight , though he reminded me a bit of kevin in " you 've got mail " ( see footnotes ) .
and , as always , typical of a chick flick / romantic comedy , there 's a seemingly endless romantic soundtrack in the background , cued up at all the right places .
this sort of got on the nerves after a while , too .
" simply irresistible " is not hard to understand , light , funny in some places , and generally disappointing because it ca n't draw the line between romance and protracted sap , between humor and tired slapstick .
and how could i refrain from making a pun ?
.
.
.
" simply irresistible " is all too easy to resist .
( first viewing , 2/6/99 )
* did anyone else think this was a tad bit similar to " you 've got mail " ( or " the shop around the corner " ) ?
business rivals fall in love .
female counterpart 's business is in danger of being shut down .
female as mother- like figure guiding her .
the annoying , hysterical ex-girlfriends .
* i _really_ like sarah michelle gellar 's wardrobe .

" you ca n't have any of this .
it 's all mine ! "
--- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested .
an evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him .
for kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered .
when something goes wrong and one of the presence 's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped .
they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm .
her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed .
the king 's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice .
during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled .
abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love .
in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm .
after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn 's .
because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself .
as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered .
if there 's one thing i ca n't stand when i see a film , it 's when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty .
films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list .
this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante 's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot .
if there are n't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone .
compelling , but ultimately not .
the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images .
the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information does n't pop up until near the end of the sequence .
when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv .
at least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett .
at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) .
for some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance .
one over-alled cretin handles the presence 's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there 's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds .
why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of " rednecks " when you yourself had all of these cool powers ?
and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ?
i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment .
the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence .
the character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated .
a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken .
he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever .
when she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her .
the presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her .
when it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ .
the box for the film claims " because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 .
contains nudity and graphic violence " .
while both is certainly true , there does n't seem to be much of either in any large amounts .
besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety .
as for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident .
ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com .
it has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent .
besides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice .
i have n't had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set .

as bad as " mimic " was , it definitly scared me .
" mimic " continued the frightening hollywood trend of taking a foreign director who shows a lot of creative ingenuity and style , and completely flushing it when he comes to america to make a movie .
director guillermo del toro was recently imported from mexico after he made the award winning and inventive horror film " cronos . "
that movie worked because it took an unconventional story , unique characters and well written plot and dialogue to create a truly scary movie .
in " mimic " , del toro does n't bother to give us anything original .
the plot is a stupid combination of " aliens " meets " species " meets " jurassic park . "
the characters have been recycled from a few hundred other movies .
there 's nothing new in " mimic " .
it 's just a bunch of old tricks that rarely work .
at the end of the movie , you 're stuck wanting your money back .
maybe the worst thing about the movie is that del toro followed another annoying trend of recent movies : he forgot to turn the lights on .
i do n't understand why suspense movies lately have to follow the " seven " trend and be set in dark , dank areas .
watching " mimic " i was tempted several times to yell at the screen " turn the lights on !
the switch is to your right !
use common sense !
just do it !
you 'll be able to see the monster in the corner ! "
there 's a scene where mira sorvino is standing in subway station while the lights are flickering on and off .
it looked like the light operator was having a seizure , and sorvino did n't even notice - she just stood there looking like she was having deep thoughts .
" hmmm . . . .
i think bean soup would be good for dinner tonight . "
" mimic " has a lot of incidental shock tactics ( boo !
just kidding ! ) and follows them up with the real scare , but nothing in this movie scares you .
the audience in the theater never jumped during suspenseful moments ; i think they were bored , too .
i should n't blame del toro .
he is n't the first successful foreign director to come to hollywood and make a bad movie .
hong kong director john woo made two of the best action films of all time , " the killer " and " hard boiled " then came to america to make the stupid " broken arrow . "
french directors luc besson ( " la femme nikita " ) and george sluizer ( " the vanishing " ) followed woo 's lead and made dumbed down versions of those movies .
robert rodriguez , who directed the terrific low budget " el mariachi " came to hollywood and directed the horrible , high-budget " desperado . "
i do n't know why a foreign director who shows such talent in his country ca n't make a good american movie .
woo finally broke through and made " face/off " , but it still is n't up to par with his earlier films .
i get the feeling a hollywood producer sits in his office , chews on a big smelly cigar and says to the director , " welcome to america !
i bet you must be tired after being on that boat for so long .
do you speak english ?
now , i know you think you 've made good movies in the past , but now you 're in america , so things are a little different here .
just remember what the american audience always wants , and you 'll be fine .
they want to see at least one big breasted woman , characters that they 've seen a thousand times before ( because change scares americans ) , and you always need a cheesy feel-good ending to wrap things up .
if you do n't make that kind of movie , you 'll be shining my shoes in no time . "

last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning .
based on the famous 60 's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west .
but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again .
and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects .
i mean , what could possibly go wrong ?
the answer is just about everything .
wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate .
there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression .
but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it .
at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting .
will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series .
my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved .
smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him .
he 's too much of a joker .
i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible .
what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office .
the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists .
the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent .
loveless has taken the country 's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns .
one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right .
the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings .
unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film 's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem .
wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works .
most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival .
if it 's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it 's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered .
kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot .
salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon .
branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film .
but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top .
rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is .
i suppose there 's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint .
wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 .
but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office .
perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith 's name stamped on a summer movie .
after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .

under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review .
however , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary .
even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk .
the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm 's past patients .
distraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself .
cut to the " next fall " , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i did n't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) .
after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has " the sixth sense " , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead .
and this , as they say , is where the healing begins .
the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert 's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of " siskel and ebert " ) .
although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i 've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one .
here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film 's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i 've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated .
and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment .
stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion .
after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power .
it 's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie .
in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come .
and when the final moments do come , it 's a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all .
it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level .
i wo n't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder .
now , in all fairness , i can not say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand .
however , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few " twilight zone " episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away .
the fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped .
ironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl 's funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy .
i would n't have even known about this mental disease if i had n't , by pure dumb luck , caught " dateline nbc " the other week when they did a feature story on it .
despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just is n't plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation .

in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america .
i guess i was expecting some sort of political question .
instead , i was dumfounded by what was most on his mind .
" in america , do wives and their mothers-in-law get along well ? "
he assured me in china that they did , but i am certain if that were true he would not have asked .
even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws .
perhaps some of life 's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage .
a man trying to relate to his new prospective in-laws and vice-versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy .
meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact , however .
greg focker ( played by ben stiller ) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes ( teri polo ) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her .
he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie 's family and to attend her sister 's wedding .
from the beginning the relationship is awkward between greg and jack and dina byrnes ( robert deniro and blythe danner ) .
through no fault of his own , the airline has lost greg 's luggage .
and he has to ask to borrow clothing .
it is the beginning of a game of one-upmanship in which greg is nearly always one-down .
as the games go on greg is more and more uncomfortable and uneasy which only contributes to the mistakes he makes .
greg is playing a game he does not understand , in a league he is new to .
but perhaps along the way he will discover some unexpected secrets about his father-in-law .
this film had potential in its tale of one-upmanship .
it has hit on a situation that many in the audience may find familiar--one that has not been done overly frequently in films .
but the script by jim herzfeld and john hamburg is a little too contrived .
too many coincidences in the story work against greg .
the script could not decide if the main character was incompetent or simply unlucky .
certainly he does not help his situation by doing everything wrong he possibly could , but even when he is trying to do the right things nature conspires against him .
there is an uneven mix of slapstick sequences and human comedy .
certainly the last part of the film feels awkwardly written .
the main reason to see meet the parents is to see robert deniro 's performance .
deniro plays the suspicious and not a little fascistic father as tightly wound and threatening as he can .
the little judgmental expressions on his face are a show in themselves as greg digs himself deeper and deeper into his insecurities .
but we do not really see much of that digging .
ben stiller is an affable presence in the film but is not really stretching himself by playing the role as the nebbish to whom so many bad things happen .
it is nice to see blythe danner again on the screen .
but her character has a basic conflict between a basic decency and her love for her husband and the script should have given her more to do with that .
randy newman has written a playful score .
in the first few seconds of the film it does something creative i have never heard a film score do before .
there is a lot of source music that is popular music of the 1960s .
presumably that is what the upper class listens to at least in somebody 's imagination .
humor is subjective and some this film has been getting some favorable comment .
but this is a comedy that works only occasionally for me .
i would have to rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

" an intimate , character-driven drama about a troubled youth at a crossroads in his life , " read the press notes for _reach_the_rock_ .
i 'm not really sure what film that statement is describing because those words bear little resemblance to the slow , completely uninvolving bore i saw--at least , it certainly does not describe what goes on for most of the film .
alessandro nivola plays robin fleming , a troubled , directionless 21-year-old who has a penchant for breaking storefront windows in a small town .
police sergeant phil quinn ( william sadler ) takes him in , and what ensues for the first 70 minutes is a tedious series of sneak-outs and sneak-ins where robin slips out of his jail cell , breaks a window , then returns , all without quinn ever noticing .
also added to the pointless proceedings is some would-be humorous shenanigans involving quinn 's dimwitted deputy ernie attempting to engage in clandestine patrol car sex with his girlfriend donna ( karen sillas ) .
with a half hour ( if even that long ) remaining , director william ryan and writer john hughes ( yes , john hughes of '80s youth films and _home_alone_ ) finally approach something close to a point .
turns out robin still pines for his high school sweetheart lise ( brooke langton ) , who has long gone on with her life , and hughes 's main concern at long last reveals itself as a tired " live in the present and for the future " message .
most moviegoers , however , will likely be asleep by that time .
wide awake , however , is the cast , who individually tackle their showcase dramatic scenes with energy and skill--thus revealing the _real_ purpose behind this listless enterprise : to serve as a series of acting exercises .
such a glorified workshop may have its rewards for the actors , but it leaves audiences with a booby prize .
( opens october 16 )

capsule : the weakest and least engaging of the alien movies , dragged down by an uninvolving story and no real tension .
alien 3 ( the " 3 " should be in superscript ) is a sad and wan entry in what was shaping up as one of the best sf sagas ever put on screen .
it continues the story of ripley , the space-trucker-turned-impromptu-survivalist , but seems remarkably uninterested in her .
in fact , the movie seems lucky to be interested in anything at all , it 's so elegaic and limp .
a little of this would have been nice for atmosphere , but the movie telegraphs its own tragedy from the beginning .
at the end of the last film ( aliens ) , ripley and two survivors were on their way home .
unfortunately , an alien pod had been deposited in their ship , and wound up triggering off their ejection in an escape pod .
the pod crashes on firorina 161 , a prison planet designed to house the incurably criminally violent .
ripley lives through the crash ; the others do not .
the prison is a grim place , even as prisons go -- it 's been built around the remnants of an abandoned steelworks , which provides no end of techno-gothic backdrops for the actors to be backlit against .
lice are endemic , and so ripley 's head is shaved ( another surreal touch ) .
at first it looks like she just has to hold out as an unwelcome guest until a company rescue ship can arrive , but it does n't stay that way .
one of the other eggs on board the wrecked escape pod hatches , and soon a newly-gestated alien is running amuck .
worse , it looks like ripley herself has been impregnated .
what 's weird is how little tension this generates , except near the end , when the pressure is being troweled on through every cheap cinematic form of cheating imaginable : loud music , shaky camerawork , etc . sigourney weaver has become comfortable with the role , and she does well with it , but this time the role has been underwritten and left slack .
the supporting actors are also not given a lot to do : the doctor ( charles dance ) and another , rather religious inmate ( charles s . dutton , very good ) , hiave presence , but they 're not asked to do anything with it .
in light of the impending sequel , which apparently plays fast and loose with the ending of this movie , i will not talk about the ending -- except to say that they found a remarkably good ending for such a drab movie .
it 's strange that some of the desperate and improvisational thinking that they found to wind up this story could n't have driven the rest of it .

when i originally saw the trailer for " analyze this " a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame .
and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad .
but then when " analyze this " finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened .
it got great reviews .
critics were proclaiming it " hilarious " and a " dead-on parody of mob movies " .
well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater .
you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ?
well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for .
" analyze this " is slow , unfunny , and badly acted .
do n't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here .
i think the problem is he did n't quite know how to approach this material .
he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama .
if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the " naked gun " series , he probably would have been a lot more successful .
as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others .
this does n't work .
it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it 's him .
and the movie is badly paced , too .
it never takes off .
it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum .
i think the blame for this should be placed on the script .
it 's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie does n't really go anywhere .
the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues .
this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie .
i 've said it before and i 'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it 's funny .
if " analyze this " had been funny , the pacing and bad acting would n't have bothered me .
i would have been too busy laughing to notice .
but as it is , i only chuckled a few times .
the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of " the godfather " .
sadly , though , i do n't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing .
but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population .
i loathed " there 's something about mary " , yet loved " baseketball " .
now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see " office space " .
it 's full of genuine laughs and wo n't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as " analyze this " did .

synopsis : a man whose lover , paris , was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system .
the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend , laura , and becomes addicted to virtual reality , which , due to a design flaw in his unit , recreates the dead paris .
comments : virtual seduction , executive produced by roger corman and lance h . robbins , serves as a cheaply-made precursor to strange days , a far superior film .
both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are ( ab ) using technology to be with former lovers ( in strange days , the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality ) .
interestingly , both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium , though strange days uses the setting far more effectively .
this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction .
it 's not bad for what it is : low-budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality .
unfortunately , it 's been done before and since in much better films , a fact which ultimately leaves the sci-fi fan bored by this movie .
virtual seduction has many faults ( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins ) .
the film 's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first , but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy-handed and wooden as the movie progresses .
many important scenes seem too dark ; the lighting could have been improved significantly .
the cast , a collection of veteran b-movie actors and sitcom regulars , do only a mediocre job in their roles .
jeff fahey , of the original lawnmower man , convincingly , though unenergetically , plays the lead character .
carrie genzel plays paris , the vr lover , but ami dolenz , as the current love interest , seems like a much more interesting and attractive character with a caring personality , which does n't lend credence to the film 's premise .
meschach taylor , of the once popular designing women sitcom , adequately plays a scientist working on the project , but his performance is n't something to write home about either .
virtual seduction is one of those harmless movies to which you could do some light manual labor and not mind having it on in the background .
in other words , one could fold laundry while glancing up at it every now and then , but it 's rather boring to just sit and watch .
the movie is surprisingly not as violent as one expects from b-movies in this genre , but it is still an adult r-rated film due to sexual situations and a suicide attempt .
this turkey , ultimately , is n't awful , but it 's not particularly interesting or unique either .
do n't be seduced into watching this movie unless you 've got several loads of laundry and nothing else to watch .

i saw this film on christmas day expecting an upbeat comedy .
boy was i in for a christmas dissapointment !
after an hour of the movie , i was ready to change rooms-into another theater !
read on to see what i have to say . . . .
four rooms :
starring : tim roth , jennifer beals , antonio banderas , quentin tarantino , valeria golino , madonna , bruce willis , marisa tomei , alicia witt , lili taylor , and ione skye .
possible stars )
" four rooms " was supposed to be one of the biggest hits of the year .
key word here : " supposed . "
four of the biggest directors in hollywood : quentin tarantino , robert rodriguez , alexander rockwell , and alison anders were all directing one big film with a big and popular cast .
i guess it was all just too much because this turned out to be the biggest flop of the year and it could of been great .
the plot : it 's new years eve and it 's a bellboy 's first day on the job .
he encounters many mysterious and kinky hotel guests as he tries to handle all his own problems .
tarantino told his directors this plot , and each of them wrote a script .
it turned out each of them had written a dark comedy .
anders wrote and directed the tale about a coven of witches ( madonna , valeria golino , alicia witt , and ione skye ) , which was the worst one out of all of them .
the second room ( jennifer beals ) was better , but lacking in plot .
this room was about a man who accuses every man of sleeping with his wife .
the third room ( antonio banderas ) was the best roomm , about two rambunctous kids that trash a hotel suite .
the final one ( tarantino , willis ) was about a movie star wanting the bellboy to chop off someone 's finger .
the movie was just plain trash .
there was nothing here that even makes up a quality film .
it was not funny , and i did n't hear one laugh in the theater throughout the whole film .
tim roth is horrible as the bumbling and mumbling bellboy , and he ruins every joke in the film .
the supporting cast loses meaning to the word support and the only mentionable actors/actresses are antonio banderas and jennifer beals .
marisa tomei appears in a stupid cameo role .
this movie is the worst film of the year and the film could have been great , perhaps like a more upbeat " plaza suite , " but it was n't .
as trashy as it was , some people will call it classic .
do you call a man chopping off a finger with madonna 's chest showing a classic film ?
look for more of ken 's kritic korner coming soon !
please check the newsgroups under the movie reviews section for updated reviews .
p . s . " four rooms " made number 1 on my top ten worst list of 1995 .

this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast .
eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck .
living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie 's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) .
maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie 's frequent disappearances .
on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love .
their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again .
like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high .
their relationship is further complicated by maureen 's pregnancy .
she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter .
during one of eddie 's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy .
she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer .
she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage .
he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years .
during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) .
her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her .
joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life .
she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie 's daughter to joey ) .
but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was .
maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him .
perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie 's denouement was not convincing .

a fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon !
hunter s . thompson 's fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960 's , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as " gonzo " .
soon after the book was written , hunter s . thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke .
and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie . )
although the book is one of my favorites , i now agree with thompson 's own assessment of the novel as " unfilmable . "
the main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road .
it was written and edited by hunter s . thomspons , relatively sober , at his home .
so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use , it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor .
hunter s . thomspon , the narrator , while always drugged out , still has a grip on reality , and can still tell , with journalistic ability , what is going on around him .
not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas .
despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped , the movie is an exact duplicate of the book , in terms of dialouge .
unfortunately , this can get annoying , in the form of johnny depp 's ( who plays thompson ) excessive narration .
and the characters , while having vivid personalities , are played as 2-d characers on the screen : dr . raoul duke ( johnny depp , the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson 's ) and his riding companion , dr . gonzo ( benicio del toro ) , who is a large samoan lawyer , have no personalities or emotions at all , save for stoned .
the film is very faithful to the plot ( what there is ) of the book , in that dr . raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 , and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs .
from there , one set of stoned adventures after another happens , including one of the few good scenes in which depp , high on acid , watches all the people in the bar around him turn into , literally , lounge lizards .
while the movie has its moments ( few ) , it is almost unwatchable at parts , especially towards the end .
despite a lot of celebrity cameos , the stars never get off the ground .
the set decoration and costumes are great , and probably deserve an oscar nomination .
however , as we all know , it 's not sets or effects that make a movie , its the characters ; and quite frankly , these characters are no good .

senseless ( r ) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian , and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life .
alas , moments are simply that , moments , which are not enough to lift this fantasy/comedy above its one-joke premise .
granted , that one joke is initially amusing .
when wayans 's darryl witherspoon , an economics major at stratford university , hits some dire financial straits , he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses .
after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses , darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm .
at this point , the film sounds more like senseful than senseless , but through some turns of the plot , darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once , essentially leaving him--yes--senseless .
this sets up some showcase moments for wayans 's gift for physical comedy , especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely , hilariously limp .
but these gags , and the gag behind the entire movie , quickly grows stale .
once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses , instead of exploring any new comic territory , director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness .
wayans approaches each go-round with gusto , but by this point he 's simply treading water for the rest of the film 's unfunny duration .
senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it did n't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle .
however , the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity .
darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash-strapped family , and this " serious " angle seems to come from an entirely different movie .
unlike wayans 's last starring vehicle , the surprisingly effective ( and serious ) the 6th man , the " emotional " content of senseless is forced and unconvincing .
any attempt at anything more substantial than broad comedy fizzles--darryl 's romance with janice ( tamara taylor ) , a young woman who yearns for a man who is true to himself , does not generate sparks of any kind .
once his wb television sitcom the wayans bros . comes to an end , the genuinely funny marlon wayans has a promising big-screen future ahead of him .
but if he continues to associate himself with projects as flat as senseless , his film career could go the way of his once-promising older brother , damon , who is now set to make his comeback--on television .

conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children 's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made .
that 's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives .
check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you 'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks .
there 's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen .
boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time .
they 'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore .
hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them .
directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time .
and for the most part they 're messing it up .
" mission impossible " , " lost in space " , " godzilla " , " zorro " .
none of these successfully capture the originals .
none of these are even good films .
you can now add " the avengers " to the list .
the british television series began in 1961 .
super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for .
surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times .
the leather-clad rigg probably did n't hurt the ratings either .
after all it 's not a coincidence that you ca n't pronounce her character 's name without " appeal " .
now we 're in the nineties .
steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england 's weather .
that 's about as much of a plot as we have .
there 's some footage about a lot of other things that either do n't make sense or make even less sense .
we get betrayal for some unknown reason .
evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film .
remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason .
there 's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone 's in it .
the spy agency is run by a man called " mother " who is in a wheelchair and a woman named " father " who is blind . . . at
least in some scenes .
there 's probably a reason for all of this , but we 'll never know it .
macnee makes an appearance of sorts .
he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing .
a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits .
at first it 's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy .
the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner .
it feels like major portions of the film are missing .
the storyline jumps rather than flows .
reportedly the film was re-cut several times .
this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing .
there 's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher .
other than that , the effects are second-rate .
the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes .
thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it does n't work .
she looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there 's no spark .
fiennes fares even less well .
macnee 's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor .
fiennes ' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town .
even connery , one of the greatest living actors , does n't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes .
the action scenes are difficult to follow .
director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of " diabolique " ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it should n't be .
things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering .
the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads .
witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination .
admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there 's no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever .
one of emma peel 's first lines of dialog is " rules are made to be broken . "
it does n't get any better .
advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone .
the release date was changed several times .
connery refuses to promote the film .
there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers .
at least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out .
admittedly i have n't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades .
my guess is that it would be severely dated now .
no matter how antiquated it might be , there 's no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing .
there 's no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie .
no reason at all .

sometimes i wonder just what the censors are thinking .
take this film , " naked killer " , among it 's ingredients are heavy doses of violence , rape sequences , straight and lesbian sex scenes and what our system calls " coarse language " .
but what do those intelligent people at the censorship bureau choose to remove in case someone will get offended ?
one word - penis .
that 's it .
in spite of everything else in the movie the one thing that the censors decide is too much is " penis . " .
it really restores you 're faith in the system , huh ?
anyway , that 's just a side point .
when naked killer was released in the local independent cinemas around melbourne , it was advertised ad nausuem as a hip , cool , controversial thriller .
what they forgot to mention was that it is n't very good .
the plot involves male cop tinam ( simon yam ) , investigating a series of brutal murders .
while getting a haircut he meets and finds himself attracted to a girl named kitty ( chingmy yau ) , who , after extracting revenge on the man who killed her father , falls in with professional killer sister cindy ( svenwara madoka ) .
realising kitty has potential , cindy decides to train kitty in several unusual and ridiculous ways and gives her a new identity .
however in the course of his investigation tinam ( who believed kitty had disappeared ) , runs into her again , but is n't quite sure if it 's her .
to complicate matters the actual serial killlers , princess and baby , who a former students of cindy , and have been told to kill their old master and her new student .
from then the action ensues . . .
all in all , this is not a well done movie .
the script is awful , the direction all over the place , the editing is jerky and confusing and the subtitling is surprisingly poor .
however the are a few stand alone pieces that do entertain .
the shoot out in the car park is almost woo-like in adrenaline .
the fight scenes are energetic and i guess it must get a few points for trying something a little different .
let me put this way , if you like action - get something else , if you like strong women in movies - get something else , if you have do decide between this and " black cat " for your hong kong female action - do n't get either .
even for curiosity value it just is n't worth it .
let 's face it - if ever the was a movie that became popular on it 's subject alone , this is it .

i did n't come into city of angels expecting greatness .
i 've never seen wim wenders ' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based .
then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold .
unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them .
the plot , for those that could n't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) .
of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye .
their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human .
using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection .
the first half of the movie succeeds on most points .
cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who does n't know feelings so ca n't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions .
unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive .
as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right .
her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning .
likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film .
when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel .
the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel .
the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie .
the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel 's eyes .
the movie devolves into an examination of how seth ca n't feel the world or , more importantly , he ca n't feel maggie : he ca n't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats .
this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth 's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears .
if he wants maggie so badly , then why does n't her just make the leap and become human ?
after all , what 's so great about being an angel ?
sure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what 's that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ?
and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it 's all downhill .
the philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience 's hankie .
it 's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film .
i feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level .
i came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing .
i could go on longer , but i do n't want to " ruin " the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on .
city of angels , then , is a paradox .
it 's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea .
all these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up .

this is crap , but , honestly , what older american audience is going to be able to resist seeing jack lemmon and james garner as bicker- ing ex-presidents ?
especially when their supporting players in- clude dan aykroyd as the current commander in chief , lauren bacall as a former first lady , and john heard as the dan quayle-ish vice president .
yup , you 're talkin ' pre-sold property here and , for warner brothers , the perfect fit into their now-ritual grumpy old men holiday slot .
for the non-discriminating viewer , my fellow americans is fine .
the raw star power alone will have audiences applauding this atrocious political- thriller road-comedy .
( they did in mine , heaven help us . )
for the rest of us , the movie is immediately tiresome .
the tone is terrible and the banter is worse .
forget wit-- lemmon and garner merely exchange profanities through most of the movie .
( has anyone counted the number of first penis references ? )
sure , some of the bits are absurdly funny , including a men 's room macarena joke , the appearance of an elvis impersonator on a trainload of tarheels , and an all dorothy marching band performing " over the rainbow " at a gay men 's march .
the get there from here , though , you have to submit to one of the most offensively overbearing musical scores of all time .
judas priest , is there a single moment of silence in this film ?
even the dialogue gets drowned out .
what a waste .

" battlefield earth " is the best comedy of the year .
it has to be .
the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider .
bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much " battlefield earth " has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand .
is it as bad as advertised ?
oh yes , very much so .
the plot is incomprehensible .
the acting is atrocious .
the special effects are mediocre .
the action is dull .
the implausibilities are legion .
the dialogue is cringe-inducing .
the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny .
i do n't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i 'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is :
the premise is basically a rip-off of " planet of the apes , " only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo .
the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved .
only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear .
one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos .
there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) .
pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back .
meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he 's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man 's daughter .
he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous .
.
. )
so the " man-animal " can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos ca n't go .
terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself .
of course , his plan does n't work .
so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ?
how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard 's sci-fi novel ?
early previews for " battlefield earth , " with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , " what the hell is travolta thinking ? "
the movie did nothing to stem such remarks .
all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo .
of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary .
the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally do n't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees .
( " you were going to be promoted -- but now you 're not !
fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! " )
it 's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he 's an idiot .
he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book .
he underestimates his enemies , assuming he 'll win just because he 's smarter .
( he uses the word " leverage " like some sort of scientologist mantra . )
not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos ' language and technology .
( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . )
he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him .
no wonder this guy never got his promotion .
the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention .
why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ?
how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ?
how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ?
and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ?
there 's a whole lot more to scratch one 's head about in " battlefield earth . "
bring a scorecard to track the plot holes .
director roger christian shoots " battlefield earth " in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason .
all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it 's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue .
the action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement .
are these things really so hard to construct ?
my respect for supposed " lightweight " action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in " battlefield earth " how badly an action sequence can be shot .
this movie is an absolute headache .
it 's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense .
for most of " battlefield earth 's " running time , i just did n't know what was happening .
it did n't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on .
when i pieced the plot together later , it did n't look any better .
here 's how much of a disaster this is : " battlefield earth " is already the worst movie of the year , and it 's going to take something really , really inept to top it .
the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it .
in fact , i 'd think that hubbard 's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible .
that 'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again .

" gordy " is not a movie , it is a 90-minute-long " sesame street " skit , and a very bad one at that .
this movie is so stupid and dumb that it 's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light , and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie .
i 'm sure children are the target audience of this movie , but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it .
it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy ( voiced by garms ) , whose family has been taken away to " up north , " which we know means death .
of course we can hear the animals talk to each other , and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but it comes out terrible .
actually , it 's almost funny in a way .
the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears , a little girl named jinnie sue macallister ( young ) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him .
jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it .
what is the point of this ?
maybe she is one of the producer 's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something .
we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce ( roescher ) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating .
he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue , but he accidentally falls in a pool ( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a $ 200 suit on - nah , did n't see that one coming ! ) ,
starts to drown , and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him .
if this had not been insanely stupid already the story quickly changes when jinnie gives gordy to hank who then ends up becoming the ceo of a food processing corporation when hank 's grandfather , the original ceo , dies and leaves his fortune to hank . . .
and gordy !
of course there must be a villain , but even this villain ( donadio as sipes ) is n't that evil .
he never raises his voice or becomes angry , and of course he has the typical idiot goons kidnap gordy but this is just so beyond stupid and cartoony we are constantly two steps ahead of the story .
it 's hard to tell whether the overall corniness and cheesiness to the movie is intentional because it is a family film , or if the filmmaker 's are just this untalented and stupid .
at times " gordy " is tolerable to watch , thus earning it one star and not the dreaded " z- . "
but it 's just so unbelievably boring , cliche , dumb , unfunny , corny , and just plain bad it may scare children , it certainly disturbed me .

poster boy for co-dependency needs patching
patch adams a film review by michael redman copyright 1999 by michael redman
mediocrity is a pox on civilization .
in our heavily consumer oriented society , there is an enormous demand to churn out " stuff . "
what would happen to our economy if we did n't feel the need to have more things ?
to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product .
the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality .
the film industry is like any other .
in order for studios to survive , they have to make money .
the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit .
some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used .
there are n't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary .
for some reason , it 's never crossed anyone 's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit .
often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones .
at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies .
i 'm not suggesting that " patch adams " was tossed out just to rake in the bucks .
my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel .
it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it 's as dull as could be .
hunter " patch " adams ' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis .
checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around .
patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency .
he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he does n't focus on his own problems .
he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia .
as a med student , patch 's antics at the school 's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) .
the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he 's one of the top students .
he writes in patch 's academic file that he shows " excessive happiness . "
i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing .
there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies .
then it struck me .
it must be based on a true story .
the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic .
robin williams is an amazing actor .
while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits .
that 's what makes his failure here so remarkable .
patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat .
something holds him back .
most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional .
for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it 's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters .
peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person .
unfortunately he 's in the film for only about two minutes .
the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .
we 're not left to our own emotional decisions : we 're hit over the head with them .
shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who ca n't love because of her abusive history .
when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy " hey , let 's put on a play !
we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains ! "
mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other .
there might as well be giant signs flashing : " feel good now ! "
" feel bad now ! "
" patch " is a good title for the film .
it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of .
the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types .
there 's a touching death .
then there 's another .
the film does n't trust us to get it the first time .
the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again .
worst of all is the final courtroom bit .
scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people .
the room is packed with patch 's supporters .
williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all .
it has as much emotion as his earlier statement " humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species " contains truth .
most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk .
shadyac also directed the first " ace ventura " movie .
oedekerk directed the second one .
need i say more ?
the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases .
the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .
the " doctors are not gods " theme will resonate with a number of people , but it 's so poorly produced that no one will care .

starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that .
junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman .
these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins .
so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins .
so much for hopes .
schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy .
unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding .
still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse .
so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug .
their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman .
does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ?
well , it must have to the producers of junior .
admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off .
perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny .
but it was n't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best .
the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny .
schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics .
i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture .
better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why did n't they make a sequel to twins ?
anything would have been better than this mess .
danny devito is wasted in this movie .
his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street .
( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . )
emma thompson is wasted here as well .
while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian .
too bad she did n't get to use any of that talent here .
am i being too hard on this film ?
i do n't think so .
schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood .
with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film .
they certainly managed here .
maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made .
if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito 's comedic talents .

what are we going to do with jim carrey ?
viewers of television 's " in living color " know this one-man cartoon from such characters as fire marshall bill .
viewers also know that " in living color " is a skit-show and that a little of jim carrey goes a long way .
unfortunately , this fact was forgotten by the makers of the carrey comedy ace ventura : pet detective .
three writers , including carrey , worked on the slapstick story , which sends a self-styled " pet detective " on the trail of a stolen dolphin .
the missing mammal belongs to the miami dolphins , who need their mascot for the upcoming superbowl .
for plot porpoises , this story works as well as any three stooges short .
carrey gets to do his " official " schtick as he snoops around greater miami .
he leers and sneers , craning his neck to funny effect .
he even does his captain kirk impersonation .
again .
all of this is pretty harmless stuff up until the point that you realize that the writers have absolutely no intention of focusing on anyone * other * than carrey .
( suggested alternate title--jim carrey : will do anything for a laugh . )
export it to france and you may have a hit .
as it stands , ace ventura is n't even good kid 's stuff .
the profanity count , alone , is too high .
which is ironic , since children are , probably , carrey 's best audience .
the film does n't even have the goofball charm of chris elliott 's recent no-brainer cabin boy .
sure , carrey has his moments .
but what can you say about a film whose high-points include watching carrey slink around to the theme from " mission impossible ? "
ace ventura has one glaring incongruity .
amid the butt-jokes and double-takes , the script takes great pains to set-up an elaborate and rather funny " crying game " gag .
and , for * this * intended audience , that takes ( ahem ) cojones .

it 's time to take cover .
after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest .
in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante 's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar .
of the two , i had heard that dante 's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video .
the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town .
the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption .
flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people .
we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing .
it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road .
symbolism does n't get much more blatant than that .
we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred .
harry survived , but his wife did not .
a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante 's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) .
there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante 's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop .
although the mayor does n't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are .
they are afraid that harry 's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante 's peak .
they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug .
however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath .
thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption .
this film contains a number of cliches .
the amorous couple is one .
as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they 're going to die .
the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog .
countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable .
watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well .
unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible .
for example , harry 's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation .
paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry 's eruption predictions are n't cause for alarm .
this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work .
when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , " cause this town 's in trouble and i 'm the best man you 've got . "
even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving .
he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water .
if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog wo n't move and will allow itself to be cooked .
" is that your recipe for frog soup ? "
asks one of the team members .
" it 's my recipe for disaster , " responds harry .
dante 's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious .
our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid .
mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , " acid eats metal . "
thanks for the tip .
when we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there 's a caption labeling it as such .
this would n't have been so bad if it were n't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , " u . s . geological survey . "
i suppose the caption is for people who ca n't read signs .
although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why .
there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this .
when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , " why do they want to kiss ?
were they even attracted to each other ? "
if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who does n't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act .
who does he think he is ?
james bond ?
the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed .
there are several " warning signs " prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we do n't feel as if they are leading up to anything .
for example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot .
a tremor occurs .
does he plunge headlong to his death ?
is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ?
no , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg .
the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well .
it was n't .
one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante 's peak .
in a disaster movie , there 's usually one guy who 's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster .
it 's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved .
if you 're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way .
in dante 's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they do n't really try hard enough .
maybe the mayor 's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one .
for no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt .
perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate .
there are a couple of good things about this movie .
the first is the scenery .
there are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful .
the second is the special effects .
they are the closest i 've ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption .
but when elements which do n't speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you 'd probably better rewrite the script .

arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year .
however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it 's not very good .
donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth .
the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles .
although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on .
although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity .
the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise .
most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie .
the 'script ' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students .
there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it 's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly .
if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i 'd go on scout camp .
but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i 'm not quite sure how .
the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes .
with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not .
i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film .
however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? '
a lot , and mike giggling like a loony .
there 's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things .
the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all .
the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it is n't very convincing .
also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation .
there are also some parts where the 'amateur ' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather 's apology being a major one .
the blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver .
i suppose if you 've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99 % of the paying audience who have n't been lost in the woods .
apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull .
the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide .
although a good idea , it 's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience .
it 's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com
) is better than the film .

actually , i 'm fairly sure the experience of having my flesh torn and mutilated by barbed wire would have been more positive than watching this movie .
" baywatch " babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d 's on the small screen .
at least there you do n't have to pay to see her cleavage .
and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire .
you would n't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in .
i ca n't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there .
they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it 's so quick you ca n't even tell for sure whether you 're seeing her andersons or not .
a nipple hallucination sort of thing .
barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions .
yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one .
she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience .
you 'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate would n't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it 's obvious she was n't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills .
i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler 's convention .
the movie is set in the year 2017 , " the worst year of my life , " pam says .
( " the worst movie of the year , " i say . )
america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) .
she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute .
but do n't call her " babe . "
she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times .
imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term .
a liberated woman like pamela anderson should n't have to hear words like " babe " during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success .
the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate 's retina scanners .
in the words of one of the characters , they 're " more than meets the eye . "
reminds me of the " transformers " cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened .
no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) .
thank god they did n't name her cora reef .
one bad character name is more than enough .
pamela originally does n't take sides , giving some speech about she 's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi " always " video fame .
i still do n't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he is n't sponge worthy ) .
pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest .
it 's not rambo . . .
it 's bimbo !
mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year .
it 's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo 's bastard cousin , the cable channel i 'd never watch if it did n't somehow come free .
it 's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo .
there 's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie 's premise while the words scroll up the screen .
someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ai n't star wars .
if you 've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you 'll recognize plenty of lifted elements .
barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death .
this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct .
barb wire has only two things going for it . . .
and i think you know what those two things are .

alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam 's adventure " the musketeer . "
for some reason that i may figure out later , i do n't know why the time , money and effort were put into the making of " the musketeer . "
it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film 's xin-xin xiong ( " once upon a time in china " ) and yuen woo-ping from " crouching tiger , hidden dragon . "
the result is a mix of genres that do n't mesh well .
elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 " the three musketeers " ) , the man with no name from " a fistful of dollars " ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano .
the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the " matrix " crowd .
alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters .
the real problem with the " the musketeer " lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) .
chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma .
suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen .
if " the musketeer " makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons .
stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one .
the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive .
catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan 's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in " the princess bride ) .
stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character .
tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal 's chief henchman , febre .
he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout .
the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , " lock , stock and two smoking barrels " ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan 's aid when needed .
peter hyam 's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well .
a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps .
photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre 's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan 's folks years before .
it is all routine stuff .
the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse .
it works in a sci-fi film like " the matrix " or in a classical fantasy like " crouching tiger , hidden dragon " but just calls attention to itself in " the musketeer . "
at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used .
it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed .
with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d .

tri-star ; rated r ( language , sexual situations , violence ) ; 87 minutes
director and writer : darren stein
cast : rose mcgowan , rebecca gayheart , judy greer , julie benz , chad christ , ethan erickson , carol kane , pam grier , tatyana m . ali .
review by : geoff berkshire
jawbreaker is the very definition of a " rip-off . "
this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s .
along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own .
the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her " foxy " , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise .
liz is everyone 's favorite because she 's both beautiful and kind .
liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning .
in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her .
they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney 's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz 's dead body ) .
courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her .
things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to .
in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into " vylette " , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students .
up until about this point the film is effective enough .
however , an investigation begins into liz 's death and the film becomes excessively dull .
the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch .
courtney 's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second .
meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot .
julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) .
he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid .
fern 's rise to popularity is equally lame .
we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section .
it 's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school 's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him .
it at least provides us with a look at courtney 's personality but the way the scene finishes does n't make any sense .
stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting .
william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz 's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie 's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman .
at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema 's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer .
the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .
the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid .
they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color .
director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve 's bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well .
shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive .
performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .
none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader .
the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like " auto stud , " " college stud , " and " high school stud # 2 . "
the soundtrack is decent and imperial teen 's catchy " yoo hoo " makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film .

the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities .
the best tales of the genre deal with mankind 's struggle for survival or knowledge .
such popular and noteworthy tomes as " stranger in a strange land " by robert heinlein , " childhood 's end " by arthur c . clarke and " man in the high castle " and " do androids dream of electric sheep " by philip k . dick all deal with man 's need for identity and struggle for self worth .
hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it 's beginnings .
most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved .
it really was n't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein 's novel " rocketship galileo " and crafted the film " destination moon " , that 'sci-fi ' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it 's own .
from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre .
with the release of touchstone pictures " mission to mars " , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe .
the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission .
woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son .
entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) .
luc consoles jim with woody 's assistance .
the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them .
but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet .
the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars .
they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface .
going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars ' .
a strange noise emanates from the rock .
as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc .
back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing .
luc 's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team .
the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger .
meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet 's surface .
the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars .
and if so , what is its relationship with us ?
now for the bad news .
the entire plot of " mission to mars " is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe .
the famed 'face on mars ' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed .
borrowing ideas from such films as " robinson crusoe on mars " ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , " 2001 : a space odyssey " , and even mario bava 's " planet of the vampires " ( 'terrore nello spazio ' ) ( 1965 ) , " mission to mars " is a hodgepodge of ideas that do n't add up to a satisfying whole .
while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving .
so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use .
the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry .
gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation .
and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse .
and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better .
he 's just having too much fun here to give a damn .
the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage .
this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship .
also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation .
but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone .
subtlety is non-existent here .
in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out .
the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower .
the pacing of the film is very leisurely .
after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface .
then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity .
the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum .
there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop .
the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at .
the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring .
the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that has n't been seen since " 2001 : a space odyssey " .
the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth .
the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world .
director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film .
the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage ' to hitchcock 's " rope " ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters .
scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution .
but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang .
sadly it is not .
director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production .
the set design and visual effects are all arresting .
but it 's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction .
a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals .

there is n't much good about this movie .
not much i can say about the acting , directing , or writing that would make you consider seeing this movie .
so i 'll get my one good comment out of the way , at least joel schuemacher ( batman & robin ) did n't direct it or it would be titled " technicolor city " .
in fact there is nothing colorful about this movie , its dark and depressingly gloomy right down to the bitter end .
the plot has a tendency to be interesting , but all that passes while your laughing at the ridiculous things thrown into what could have been a fascinating movie .
the plot is impossible to explain due to how senseless it gets , so i will just touch on the bare minimum .
john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) awakes in the bathtub of a cheap hotel , only to find out he has forgotten everything .
john must find out who he is before the " strangers " ( a . k . a .
mind erasing aliens ) find him and use him for their own evil conspiracy .
during the film some interesting points are raised about human individuality , and the existence of inherently evil people .
any of these points however are completely " erased " from your mind as you watch the actors stumble through the dreadful script .
as i mentioned earlier , nothing but the atmosphere is right in this film .
the acting is bland , and since there is virtually no character development no one seems to care .
the special effects are low budget and some even hilariously fake , a sign of a true " b-movie " .
the direction is poor and there is little continuity , not that you would expect it in a movie switching realities constantly .
lastly the script is weak and has no concept of reality , and does n't deserve to have the word " science " in science-fiction .
if i have n't got my point across , i 'll say it more plainly : this is a bad movie .
lets hope the next movie by alex " i wish i was tim burton " proyas is at least tolerable .

summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money .
wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies .
will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses .
he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing .
west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . )
before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i 'll give it a chance with the positives .
there 's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough .
there 's also a pleasant soundtrack .
buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes .
and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see .
apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works .
firstly , there 's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money .
one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise .
both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end .
not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material does n't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy .
therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious .
the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it 's embarrassing .
she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith .
her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character .
the 'humour ' in the film is also very off .
will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display .
the script largely boils down to insults that are n't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk .
it 's also somewhat racist , although it does n't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself .
it 's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably .
the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it is n't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness .
there 's also problems with the plot .
jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill .
plot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly .
the main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there 's no particular reason why it should be built .
why not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that 's just begging to be blown up ?
director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair .
wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more .
it 's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star ca n't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it 's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight .

this is your definitive " hollywood " movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we 've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , was n't used enough here ) , i 'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable .
in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend .
while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her .
over money ( how original ) .
while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition .
now she has learned about a law titled " double jeopardy " stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) .
now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims .
skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [ simon birch ] and even very good to great [ kiss the girls ] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . .
but she 's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) does n't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away .
as i 'd said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with .
he was much more of a supporting character .
which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with .
i feel this film had alot going for it .
originality not being an issue .
the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive .
the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better .
the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) .
i was just left unsatisfied in the long run .
so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway .
keep this in mind , if you 're in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive .

michael richards leaves his spot as kramer on the infamous seinfeld tv sitcom for a stint as a lanky , goofy best friend to jeff daniels ' lawyer character in this ill-fated , and unfunny , " comedy " .
plot : richard the actor ( richards ) has to take the place of charles the lawyer ( daniels ) in a real court case , after charles is left unintelligible from a night of heavy drinking at his bachelor party .
the film follows the antics of the two men as they try to get away with their tomfoolery .
critique : this movie did not make me laugh once .
perhaps it was because i was tired when i watched it .
perhaps .
perhaps it was because i had seen richards perform most of the same schtick a thousand times on seinfeld .
perhaps .
perhaps it was because the movie just was n't funny .
absolutely .
the lack of humour was n't the only issue that i had with this film either .
the movie attempts to weave a couple of love stories through its vision , but unfortunately , they are also lacking in conviction , believability and credibility .
they are contrived and appear to be placed into the story for convenience sake .
the actors were all adequate enough in their roles , but the problem did n't lie in the acting .
i wish i could find one good reason for you to see this waste of time , but i ca n't .
unless of course , you need something playing on your tv set while you waste some time around the house .
overall , this movie stinks .
on the good side , charlize theron is darn cute , and the movie is no longer then 90 minutes .
on the bad side , this movie is not funny , interesting or enjoyable in any which way possible .
a person would n't even enjoy his nachos while watching this emptiness .
please skip it .
little known facts : jonathan lynn earned a degree in law from cambridge before becoming an actor/director .
charlize theron grew up on a farm outside benoni , south africa , as the only child .
at the age of 18 her mother made her go to los angeles to try a career in the movie industry .
she came to la without knowing anyone in the city but after two weeks when she was standing in line on hollywood boulevard an agent gave her his card .
after eight months in la she got her first part .
since then she has taken acting lessons and her career has skyrocketed , specifically in devil 's advocate ( 8/10 ) .
charlize was narrowly beat out by elizabeth berkley for the lead role in the " movie " , showgirls .
she was quoted as saying " it was like i had some guardian angel . "

plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony .
naturally , this got me worried .
would jake 's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ?
if it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in .
if it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel .
unfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm .
carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman .
as the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else .
the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . )
hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead .
plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose .
although undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there 's very little merit contained in the film .
carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped .
it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script .
the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there 's very little development in the story .
also , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened .
the story is a bit of a mess , frankly .
the performances are n't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest .
her irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on .
she looks nice , though .
more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well .
ken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character .
i did n't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived .
although a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets .
but production design alone ca n't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess .
jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this ' and 'stand and f * cking deliver ' splattered all over the place .
the mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty .
plunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment .
although somewhat enjoyable during parts , it 's so light it could float off the screen if it was n't just images on a reel .
there 's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers .
although it 's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it 's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite .
sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it 's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video .
give it a miss .

the main problem with martin lawrence 's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it does n't seem to do anything except justify the woman 's actions .
that is especially the case in lawrence 's darnell wright .
he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long .
now do n't think i condone this just because i 'm male .
my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her .
darnell does n't think like this .
he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them .
and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , " i 'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? "
after all , it is largely darnell 's fault .
if he is lining up all these women , you 'd think he 'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does .
but he does n't , so you get the sense that he 's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb .
you especially get this sense that he 's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her .
( i 'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! )
now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it 's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage .
one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with .
brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell 's " immature play " as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life .
but all of a sudden she says yes .
but when you listen to darnell 's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him !
lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies .
look at this movie .
four writers , as a result it 's too long ( two hours , when it could 've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers did n't get along ) , all of which is n't necessary .
there are some bright spots , though .
whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot .
and there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they 're just not enough to sustain the film .

funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways .
the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature .
what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters .
" get new jobs ! "
was one line , if i remember correctly .
at the end of the 19th century , col . patterson ( val kilmer , whose irish accent comes and goes like an african zephyr ) is an engineer who has been hired to build a british railway bridge across the tsavo river in uganda .
he is having immensely stereotypical problems : the natives are restless , his boss is a jerk , and now two man-eating lions are stalking the work camp and killing people off .
patterson tries to handle the situation himself , incompetently , and then turns to charles remington ( michael douglas ) , a hunter of world reknown ( or something like that ) .
the movie stacks the deck so heavily in favor of the lions , they should have gotten top billing and co-starred with siegfried and roy .
they are nigh-invulnerable , as one comic book put it , and this is of course just the excuse the movie needs to have one native after another stepping forth to solmenly recite lines about the power of nature .
give me a break .
the movie has n't got the wherewithal to even begin to exploit such ideas ; it 's just trying to find convenient ways to stall us .
even the lion hunts themselves are idiotic .
get this : remington 's big plan is to build a large scaffold-like structure in the middle of the savannah , sit on it , and wait for the lion to show up .
he does this , and then gets knocked off by a bird .
by the end of the movie , the blood vessels in my palm were all broken open from me pounding my forehead with my hand .
the acting is forgettable .
douglas does a good job of portraying a relatively cracked fellow , but it 's nothing he has n't done before .
kilmer looks like he wishes he were someone else , somewhere else , and the rest vanish into the cinematography .
the camera , by the way , sometimes behaves so stupidly all by itself that most of the lion attacks are incoherent .
what did i expect from this movie ?
i dunno .
some real excitement , i suppose .
a sense that there were formidable forces on both sides of this equation .
no such luck .
i dug out my tattered copy of hemingway 's " the short happy life of francis macomber " and read that to get the taste of this movie out of my mind .

gord brody ( tom green ) is an aspiring animator approaching thirty who still lives in parents jim ( rip torn ) and julie 's ( julie hagerty , " airplane " ) basement .
as dad declares all out war , gord secures a job in a cheese sandwich factory in far off la and sets off to make his dreams come true .
gord does n't make much of a go on his first attempt and lands back home with fawning mom and outraged dad in " freddy got fingered . "
tom green cowrites ( with " tom green show " scribe derek harvie ) , directs and stars in what is essentially tom green 's primal scream .
so , if tom green screams in an empty theater , does he make a sound ?
it 's clear that " freddy got fingered " is at least partially autobiographical and green sure has one hell of a complex about his dad ( mom gets off easier when sonny boy advises her to go out and have sex with basketball players and greeks ) .
while this may be of interest to his hard core fans , there 's little about green 's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else .
the film starts promisingly enough , with a well executed skateboarding scene through a shopping mall set to the sex pistols ' 'problem ' ( green 's put together a first rate soundtrack ) and yes , i laughed a few times .
green 's flummoxing of a security guard with psychotic ramblings and his attempt to draw , make music and eat at the same time ( the 'daddy would you like some sausages ' scene repeatedly shown in the film 's trailer ) are inspired comedy .
but what 's funny about a paraplegic girlfriend who gets turned on by having her legs caned or a skateboarding injury that results in an exposed kneecap ?
a baby delivery bit shows some groan-inducing promise until enough blood is splattered to coagulate the laughs .
younger ( by three years ) brother freddy 's internment at the institute for sexually abused children does nothing but confirm one 's worst fears regarding the film 's title and green 's infamous 'handling ' of a real horse , while not nearly as shocking as it would seem , does n't make sense .
by the time he repeats the gag with an elephant at film 's end , the overall effect is numbness .
while " freddy got fingered " has the admirable end result of depicting the harm in demeaning a child 's self esteem , it 's essentially a whole lot of tom green running around being noisy .
rip torn , what were you thinking ?

i am continually amazed at movies like this .
that some producer would waste an abundance of talent and money on a script as abysmal as this one is mind-boggeling , but it seems to happen a lot nowadays .
" wild wild west " is a beautifully filmed , well acted , and well directed piece of garbage ; and its insipid screenplay is completely at fault .
in short , this movie is a comedy without laughs .
so many jokes fall flat that it borderlines surreal .
the high production values keep it from being a total fiasco , but it 's still pretty boring .
will smith stars as jim west , an old western , r&b variation of the james bond character .
west is teamed up with artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , and they 're pretty much polar oppisites : west prefers to solve his problems with an array of bullets , gordon traditionally favors a more pacifistic approach .
talk about deeply developed characters .
at any rate , this leads to the inevitable conflicts between methodologies , none of which are funny .
the year is 1869 .
several top scientists have been abducted , and the suspected culprit is a disgruntled former confederate general , bloodbath mcgrath ( ted levine ) .
president grant sends west and gordon to investigate .
there 's evidence that mcgrath is attending some sort of confederate reunion in louisiana .
west and gordon show up and learn that mcgrath is actually working for dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , another disgruntled former confederate .
as it turns out , loveless plans to use the combined knowledge of the scientests to create the ultimate super weapon , which he will use to conquer the united states .
i 'd go further with the plot , but there is n't any point .
this film 's narrative is little more than a jumbled , unfunny mess .
i only laughed at a couple of jokes , and then only lightly .
there is n't one truly uprorously funny moment in this film , and that 's pretty disasterous when you consider that it 's primarily a comedy .
as i said , the fault is totally that of the script .
when you consider their respective roles , will smith and kevil kline do as good as they could have possibly done .
the leads could 've been played samuel l . jackson and robert de niro and the film still would 've been awful .
no one , and i mean no one , can make a line like " bye bye , mr . knife guy ! "
sound good .
still , this film has a lot going for it visually .
the set design is fantastic , maybe even oscar worthy .
the cinematogrophy by michael ballhaus ( who was also behind camera in martin scorsese 's brilliant " goodfellas " ) , is absolutely stunning .
he lends the film a much needed exciting , comic bookish look .
i wo n't fault barry sonnenfeld either .
he does a fine job of directing the proceedings , but , like the rest of the people involved with the film , there really is n't anything that he can do to correct its one major flaw .
despite being beautifully made , " wild wild west " becomes quite boring after the half-way point .
the appeal of the visuals ends long before the film does .
if " wild wild west " did n't look so good , it would be almost insufferable .
as it is , it 's somewhat tolerable , but not very entertaining .
it hurts to give such a well made movie a score this low , but there is n't anything much worse than an unfunny comedy .

the summer of 00 ' was n't a very good one for devout cinephiles .
it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update .
nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o ' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : " quality " films ) compete for audiences .
alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season .
it 's also indie director neil labute 's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i 'm sad to report it 's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that 's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute 's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic .
i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it 's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment .
are critics so desperate for something unique that they 're blind to how derivative the particular brand of " uniqueness " betty dolls out is ?
for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material .
betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [ stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie ] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation .
it 's labute 's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he does n't even seem to have half that heart in it .
nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) .
she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities .
she 's blocked out her husband 's death and thinks she 's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love .
betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit .
the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime .
the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute 's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things " average " people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are .
in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim " boys will be boys " .
another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby !
what was once so powerful about labute 's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic .
obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty is n't it .
he clearly has little passion for what he 's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger had n't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience .
nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue .
they evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that 's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) .
i think rock is a great comic yet he has n't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it 's like he 's doing the damn chris rock show .
surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks .
that wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body .
it 's the best work she 's ever done .
freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it .
the actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty 's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality .
that 's interesting but the movie does n't do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle .
the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie 's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it 's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing .
the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke .
betty 's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty would n't make any progress in the film .
nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim 's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim 's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don'tcha think .
betty has an interesting theme , though it does n't even seem aware of this .
the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way .
this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) .
instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s ) , the film simply uses betty 's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .

i 've got to admit it . . .
i 'm a huge jim carrey fan .
i loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good .
until i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying .
sadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be .
carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i .
the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) .
soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other .
once again , it 's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills .
those who have been disappointed by carrey 's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel does n't capture the feel of the original .
the original benefited from what looked to be carrey 's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny .
here , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise .
instead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly .
but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself .
in the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey 's off-the-wall approach .
but here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey 's style .
there are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between .
they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber .

the happy bastard 's quick movie review
the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really .
shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control .
sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there 's something about mary and dumb and dumber .
since the duo directed and did n't write the script , i can assume that 's part of the problem .
the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970 's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world .
his popularity has gone through the roof and he 's getting his career off the ground .
then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything .
these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed 's abandoned him and he 's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine .
forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while .
however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm .
with the kid 's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada .
of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he 's amish .
this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy 's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow .
finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) .
the main problem i had with kingpin was n't the fact it was n't funny .
in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy 's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) .
but that 's just it- scenes .
there 's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend .
i mean , was this really necessary ?
could n't have this been handled just a bit wackier ?
i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ?
particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ?
that really ruined it , however , and that 's too bad .
the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting .
still , if you 're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ?
at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i 'd still be a little bit irked .

call " hush " " stop or my mom will kill . "
or " mommy fearest . "
or " the hand that robs the cradle . "
call it whatever you want , but certainly do n't see it unless you 're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- " hush " scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure .
chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given " hush " a send-off that 's downright infuriating .
it 's too bad that " hush " is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at .
paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family 's horse farm/estate kilronan .
jackson 's mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be .
but it seems that martha 's friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she 's what you 'd call someone who loves too much .
martha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she 's concerned .
if there 's one reason to catch " hush , " it 's lange .
she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field .
when she delves into martha 's dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who is n't there , poking a hole in helen 's diaphragm so she 'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it 's moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch .
veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson 's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother .
the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow .
but can you really blame them ?
the character relationships in " hush " hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity .
idiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( " why did you yell ? "
helen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made .
you can see through a great deal of martha 's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ?
does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ?
if any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , " hush " would be a really short movie .
and then there 's the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses .
after a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself .
i wo n't spoil what happens next except to say that it 's contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i 'm no doctor ) medically impossible .
the final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever .
it 's just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure .
no one should like this ending , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material .
perhaps " hush " 's title is a plea to silence its audience 's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .

in " the astronaut 's wife , " charlize theron plays a young woman with a nervous demeanor , pixie-hairdo and demon spawn unwittingly growing in her belly .
if only her name was n't jillian , the makers of this embarrassing bit of sci-fi shlock could have come up with a far more appropriate title : " rosemary 's species . "
what a shame it is to see such a gifted actress as theron - oscar-worthy in " the devil 's advocate " - struggle with the lamest rip-off of a screendom classic in recent memory .
ok , maybe " the astronaut 's wife " deviates from " rosemary 's baby " turf for its set-up , which finds our heroine terrorized not by satan 's minions but her possessed husband ( johnny depp ) , a shuttle pilot whose mission mishap leaves him , um , a changed man .
predictably , he and the missus get it on in a sequence best described as unpleasant , his evil seed impregnating her with twins and realizing that great " bowfinger " line about " alien love . "
theron 's " advocate " character faced a similar dilemma , the horror there resonating strongly .
" astronaut " provides only artificial anxiety .
last year 's equally noodle-headed " species ii " spun a similar premise about the breeding habits of an extraterrestrial on earth , but at least that movie more or less knew it was garbage .
" the astronaut 's wife " is grave and humor-free , passing its increasingly silly story off as full-fledged serious , right down to an ambiguous finale that is n't even going to satisfy those who 've stayed with it thus far .
here 's a hint : it involves lots of water , electrical equipment , a special effect from " the abyss " and the tots who doubled up as adam sandler 's co-star in " big daddy . "
draw your own conclusions .
director/writer rand ravich coats the proceedings in dynamic sights masterminded by legendary " e . t . "
cinematographer allen daviau , but too often favors the film 's visual presentation over the story he 's trying to tell .
this bodes horribly for each dramatic development , like the surfacing of a suspicious nasa official ( " speed " 's joe morton ) to instigate jill 's slow and stupid comprehension of the truth .
his hyper-erratic behavior is probably supposed to give wife a paranoid edge .
instead , he adds to the phoniness .
theron and depp are certainly beyond this junk and will get other chances to prove themselves this fall - she as part of an imposing ensemble case in the john irving adaptation " cider house rules , " he in the lead of tim burton 's eagerly-awaited " sleepy hollow . "
undeserving of such talent , " the astronaut 's wife " manages to be derivative , dull and uninvolving despite its seemingly ripe potential for unintentional laughs .
in space , no one can hear you scream .
but in a movie theatre , everyone can hear you snore .

if you 're into watching near on two hours of bored , foul-mouthed florida teens having sex , doing drugs , having sex , listening to eminem , having sex , playing video games , having sex , and killing one of their peers , then " bully " 's for you .
based on jim schutze 's novelization of a true-life event , " bully " charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who , in 1993 , murdered their high school bully in cold , calculated blood .
the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers .
in the hands of controversial director larry clark ( " kids " ) , however , it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker 's pornographic proclivities .
in terms of the incident and what provoked it , " bully " stirs up nothing new .
the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot--bored with life , not much ambition , promiscuous , profane .
the bully in question , bobby kent ( nick stahl ) , is certainly an unpleasant piece of work but he does n't exactly tower over his colleagues in the pathological department .
he hounds and harries and humiliates his " best friend " marty ( played by brad renfro ) and marty 's girlfriend lisa ( rachel miner ) does n't care for it at all and comes up with the idea of killing bobby .
simply remove him from the equation .
marty and lisa and a handful of their promiscuous , profane , and stoner friends , plus a recruited hit man ( ? ) , lure bobby to a swamp one night , stab him , beat him over the head with a baseball bat , and dump him into the canal where the sand crabs and the gators , presumably , finish him off .
there 's no remorse--the next day they 're talking about it as openly as a homework assignment .
they did it because they wanted to , and because they could .
what 's most troubling about the film , however , is n't the unsettling subject matter and the matter-of-fact way these young people go about eliminating one of their own but the way in which clark is constantly distracted by his own material .
not only is the nudity plentiful and graphic in " bully " but there 's also an uneasy , exploitative feel to it .
gratuitous crotch shots abound ( one of which makes the zipper cut-away in " there 's something about mary " look like the height of subtlety ! ) .
clark is so pre-occupied with his female ( predominantly ) leads that you forget , at times , what this movie is supposed to be about .
the stripping bare , literally and figuratively , of these actors ( who are , after all , playing underage teenagers ) becomes harder to watch over time , as you begin to feel for them and question the motives of the man behind the camera .
the conclusion of " bully " offers up literal snapshots of information about the sentences imposed on each of the protagonists for their involvement in the crime .
it 's a short sequence of stills--heather : 7 years ; ali : 40 years ; lisa : life imprisonment , for example--but it 's infinitely more telling than the 110 minutes of rampant unpleasantness that precedes it .
" bully " aims for truth , exploits it shamelessly , then bludgeons it to death .

martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger .
he 's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck .
they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) .
i 'm sure the guy 's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked " under siege " ) .
of course , this one , as a change , has a " message " that is drilled into our mind . . . of
course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people .
so why do i watch his crap ?
i usually do n't .
i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man 's movies , unless , and only unless , he 's in a supporting role ( i . e .
" executive decision " ) and i 'd definitely pay if he dies ( i . e .
" executive decision " ) .
but this one has a special place in my heart .
this does n't mean it 's good or that i even liked it .
this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la " mystery science theatre 3000 , " and this was a couple years before i had heard of " mystery science theatre 3000 . "
in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine .
it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land .
around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new " fire down below , " another " message film " ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or
does he ?
seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here .
one of caine 's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally ,
of course .
at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he does n't have any options but blow stuff up .
he even goes as far as to say , " i do n't want to kill someone , " and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is .
i have no problem with violence .
i 'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence .
in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them .
at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does .
this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it did n't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer 's " con air . "
but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message .
i would n't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence .
but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer 's mind .
the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we ca n't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job .
then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you did n't get the message from the trailers .
what seagal does n't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but does n't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish .
as far as seagal and his acting , he 's rather boring .
he squints , he kills .
period .
nothing else .
oh , yeah , there 's corny one-liners ( " i 'm gon na reach out and touch someone ! " ) .
of course , he 's the star , and we 're supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks .
michael caine , who 's a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold .
he does it well , i guess , but this is no " alfie . "
of coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him .
his big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible .
and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from " full metal jacket " ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal 's ego .
and also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey 's assasins .
anyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal 's movies is to judge all of them ( except for " under siege " and " executive decision , " though the latter is not really a " seagal movie " ) .
they all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch .
i mean , if you do rent it , and i do n't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes .
but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one .
my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock )

susan granger 's review of " glitter " ( 20th century-fox )
there 's less here than meets the eye .
or , put it this way , if you thought madonna was awful in " shanghai surprise , " mariah carey 's worse in this reworking of " a star is born . "
she plays billie frank who , despite being abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother ( valerie pettiford ) , believes she 's destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is .
" you 've got this amazing gift , and you got ta use it , " her roommate says .
" your voice - it 's incredible , " says another singer .
" i ai n't never met anyone like you , " proclaims julian " dice " black ( max beesley ) , the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali-like producer/lover .
problem is : her signature song , " i did n't mean to turn you on " is wretched .
and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to " exploit " her by having her wear a bikini , the audience bursts into laughter .
exploit mariah carey , who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow ?
come on !
writer kate lanier 's script is fatuous and director vondie curtis-hall does n't have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and , as a result of their incompetence , whispery-voice 'd ms . carey seems to be embarrassed on-screen .
she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close-up , pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes .
talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept , and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline , there 's an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view .
perhaps one of the reasons ms . carey suffered her highly-publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker .
on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , " glitter " is a pathetic 1 .
right now , it 's tops on my list of the worst of 2001 .

mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .
as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .
it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .
in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .
toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .
the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .
something else is what he did .
the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .
she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .
meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .
she wants to build a career as an actress .
betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .
she does not know who the woman is .
she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .
they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .
meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .
he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .
these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .
there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .
in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .
a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .
lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .
he just chooses not to .
as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .
there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .
the film is a little long for the subject matter .
toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .
unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .
i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .
mulholland drive spoiler warning .
i have rated this film fairly low .
you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .
david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .
most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .
in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .
what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )
playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .
the first 80 % of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .
then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .
the audience expectation is that they will add up .
but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .
lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .
in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .
there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .
mad magazine called it a poiuyt .
other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .
look at small portions of it and makes sense .
look at the whole figure and it does not .
this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .

" payback , " brian helgeland 's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997 's " l . a . confidential " ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it .
mel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( " conspiracy theory " and " lethal weapon 4 , " anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50 % share of $ 140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead .
porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay .
the tagline for " payback " is , " get ready to root for the bad guy , " and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way .
i would n't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it was n't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever .
no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them .
just because the protagonist , a " bad guy , " is played by mel gibson does n't mean i will " root for him , " and i did n't .
quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) .
since none of the respectable actors in " payback " actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out .
lucy alexis liu ( of t . v . 's " ally mcbeal " ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat .
meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging .
unger , who made an impression in 1997 's " the game , " is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback .
finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he did n't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) .
like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking .
in the course of the 102-minute running time of " payback , " porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer .
and guess what ?
not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) ,
even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag .
" payback " is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen .
perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours .

hello kids .
today the movie studios want to take over my critical review , and somehow persuade you that _armageddon_ , the summer 's biggest blockbuster , is a film for everybody .
and remember , if a film is for _everybody_ , and if it makes the most money for the summer , it _must_ be good , right ?
armageddon is a comedy , with a capital " c " .
it stars bruce willis , who has a hundred one-liners !
it has a tiny rock land directly in the middle of a heated argument in new york city ! !
and , chuckle , chuckle , one of those new yorkers , _survives_ , with charcoal all over his face ! !
snorkle , * sniff * , hiccup .
and it has steve buscemi as a _genius_ who wants to work for an oil rig ?
knee-slap ! !
is n't this just so , so , funny ! ?
armageddon also has romance , with a capital " r " .
it has a tender moment between * forbidden lovers * ben affleck and liv tyler , with , with , animal crackers !
and it has will patton as a long lost husband trying to reunite with his separated wife and child , who thinks he 's a salesman !
gurgle , * sniff * , awwwww .
and it has steve buscemi spewing more one-liners about minors and strippers .
umm , moving right along . . .
armageddon also has lots of action , with a capital " a " .
not just any action sequence would do .
it must have _original_ action sequences that are designed to thrill .
like , drill , darn it , drill ! ! !
and , let 's have inept people destroy the mir space station ! !
ca n't you hear your heart beating ! ?
and steve buscemi goes crazy and starts shooting at people ! !
what drama ! !
lastly , armageddon is out there to save the planet , with a capital " p " .
this ca n't be any old thriller--we must have an asteroid , the size of texas head straight for earth ! !
and , and , we must have beautiful scenic worldwide shots , like paris , blown up .
and , and , we must have peoples of all colors , nations , and religions , join hand in hand for one final , hopeful , hug .
the final sequence , where muslims in prostrate worship stand up--in domino fashion--to cheer the victory , filled me with such emotional goo that i wanted to , to , to rip the screen into shreds ! !
i mean , i mean , cheer for ecstatic joy !
( it was over ) .
comedy . " c " .

okay , kids , what does that spell ?
seriously , folks .
any film that could take the indie-films ' most valuable talents , and throw it all away with a bruce willis vehicle , a hundred-million dollar budget , but have cheap-o sets and lousy special effects , is , bottom line , living proof that hell exists , and has made a multi-picture deal with universal .
in the midst of all the action , the terseness , the one-liners , the fake sets , the overall waste of time , i recognized matt malloy playing an underwritten nasa technician ( " malloy , give me a reading " ) .
remember him ?
he was a principal player in last year 's _in the company of men_ , a film that was more powerful , shocking , terrifying , funny , and shocking than _armageddon_ could ever aspire to be .
_armageddon_ cost over $ 100 million to make .
_itcom_ cost a paltry $ 30 , 000 .
need i say more ?

" the world on land -- it 's just too big for me . "
starring tim roth , pruitt taylor vince , bill nunn , clarence williams iii .
rated r .
the legend of 1900s is the year 's most absurd movie , a rambling , nonsensical piece of seafaring garbage that goes nowhere fast .
it stars thespian extraordinaire tim roth , looking wistful as ever , as a guy named . . .
1900 .
you heard right .
his name is , in all actuality , 1900 .
he was born on an ocean liner on 1/1/1900 ( uh , hence the name ) , abandoned and adopted by danny , a ship crewman .
1900 spends most of his early years hiding in the bowels of the ship because of danny 's fear that he might be taken away from him because of " visa matters . "
well , when 1900 is about 9 or so , he starts wondering all around the ship .
one day , he discovers a grand piano .
he sits down and starts playing .
miraculously , what comes out is beautiful .
a group of onlookers gathers to watch this stunning prodigy make such amazing music at such a young age .
when one of the people who knows 1900 tells him that his playing the piano like that without permission is " totally against regulations " 1900 replies " f * ck the regulations ! "
ho ho ho .
1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land .
when he 's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody 's business , onboard comes another musician .
his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet .
after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano 's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it .
how the chair they 're sitting on and the piano do n't separate , i do n't know , but this apparently is n't the kind of thing we 're supposed to ask .
after that , 1900 and max become friends .
max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so .
what 's more , he does n't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp !
-- they 're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record .
the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900 's music in a store .
the record should n't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken .
ladies and gentlemen , it 's a mystery !
the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .
we 're supposed to be roused by a climactic . . .
piano duel ?
there is n't anything in this movie with the potential to compel .
1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i ca n't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life .
ditto for max , who does n't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 .
tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there 's no spirit , no gusto to the character .
he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead .
pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit .
the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering " king of jazz " who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel .
the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many .
this effort is utterly limp and lifeless .
at once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten .

mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect .
a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile .
however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie 's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever .
jackie chan plays , who else , jackie .
this time out , he 's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show .
not that it ever makes a difference in the plot .
there are only two scenes of him cooking .
for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop .
it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ?
a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons .
although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm ,
shades of broadcast news ? ? ?
anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape .
here lies another crucial flaw in the story : does n't anyone realize you can copy a tape ?
oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense .
as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , would n't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape .
this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie .
in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language .
however , that does n't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie 's recent americanized releases .
strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too .
whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie 's dubbed films .
the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons .
but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie 's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread .
look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ?
watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts .
the action is a mixed bag here .
there 's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie 's films .
it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan .
the action in the film is neither jackie 's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes .
the film 's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting .
once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence .
but to slo-mo jackie running ?
either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down .
if you 've seen all of jackie 's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy .
however , if you 're just in the mood for some good action , you 'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .

the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence .
it 's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it does n't make a shred of sense .
and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ?
james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor .
but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train .
at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role .
chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop .
he 's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he 's very familiar with chinatown .
that 's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) .
nick and danny begin by stepping on each other 's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one 's life .
what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me .
i 'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) .
i 'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff .
i 'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way .
there 's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny 's father ( brian cox ) , but it does n't have much to do with the main story .
one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie does n't make any sense .
i do n't blame this entirely on foley , because he 's obviously a good director .
i 'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci 's script , which does n't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act .
one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he 's angry about his new white partner .
he 's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me .
( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . )
there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent .
there 's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents .
the plot itself never straightens out .
i 'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group .
the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences .
the sequences are n't bad , but they 're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ?
on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ?
one too many , i 'd imagine .
foley 's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here .
the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together .
chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep .
wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he 's still fun to watch .
i also liked the subplot involving danny 's father ; brian cox 's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny .
but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes .
a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it 's over .
the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there 's nothing left to hold on to .

so , it 's thirty years later , and oscar and felix are together again .
that might have been an exciting notion if it was n't for the fact that the " odd couple " of jack lemmon and walter matthau have been reunited in several recent movies : 1993 's " grumpy old men , " 1995 's " grumpier old men , " and 1997 's " out to sea " ( i . e .
" grumpiest old men " ) .
so , " the odd couple ii " ( i . e .
" the grumpiest old men of all , really " ) seems just another entry in a tired series .
the plot is even similar to that of " grumpy old men " in that lemmon and matthau 's mismatched characters are brought together by a romance between their children .
oscar 's son ( jonathan silverman ) and felix 's daughter ( lisa waltz ) are getting married , and former roommates felix ungar ( lemmon ) and oscar madison ( matthau ) meet at the airport and decide to share a car .
.
.
then hilarity ensues .
well , a few chuckles ensue anyway .
neil simon , the award-winning playwright who created oscar and felix , provides the screenplay , which is a shock , because the script is a piece of talentless hackwork from beginning to end .
unlike the original play/movie , " odd couple ii " does n't find its humor in the personality conflict of its characters .
instead , it depends upon a series of humorous situations : oscar and felix lose the car over a cliff , are caught smuggling mexicans over the border , take up with two women on the run from their violent husbands ( the women are played by christine baranski of " cybill " and jean smart of " designing women " ) , and hitch a ride with a man who dies in the desert .
the original 1968 movie " the odd couple " remains a classic comedy .
it introduced the motif of roommate-as-spouse that has provided gags for movies and sitcoms ever since .
it was the second outing for the lemmon/matthau team ( which debuted in 1966 's " the fortune cookie " ) , and they made a couple more worthwhile comedies , " the front page " ( 1974 ) and " buddy buddy " ( 1981 ) , before going their separate ways .
the reunion of lemmon and matthau in " grumpy old men " six years ago was delightful , and its sequel seemed appropriate because it tied up some loose ends from the first movie .
but " out to sea " and " the odd couple ii " are just beating a grumpy old horse .
( you can add lemmon 's " my fellow americans , " i . e .
" grumpy old presidents , " to that list , too . )
let 's hope that hollywood offers these two actors something fresh to do .
let 's hope also that we see neil simon 's name on movies that do it justice ( this is his first since 1993 's " lost in yonkers " ) .

" desperate measures " is a generic title for a film that 's beyond generic .
it 's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more " before and after " than " reversal of fortune . "
the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it 's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing .
too bad the execution 's all wrong , though , because the set-up of " desperate measures " boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use .
san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission .
even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society .
connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he 's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital .
when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy .
one misstep " desperate measures " makes is in its underdevelopment of matt 's illness .
what 's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow .
take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital .
the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ?
he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight .
connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son .
whatever .
to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie 's problems .
first and foremost is how cheaply " desperate measures " trades the potential of it 's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour .
once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills .
there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away .
also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia 's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; " desperate measures " appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie 's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this .
there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department .
cast against type , michael keaton 's understated menace is highly effective .
although he 's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord .
joseph cross , as garicia 's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos .
this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost .
it goes without saying that " desperate measures " needs an operation of its very own .

this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard .
the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend . . . ned
kelly , the so-called robin hood of the aussies .
but he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly .
the film opens to a b/w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution .
then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family .
this scene is set in 1871 .
in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein 's lyrics , which tells -- of ned 's hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic .
ned says a debt must be paid . . .
as he hears voices from his dead father , his class-divided country , and his conscience , all telling him to get revenge .
so begins ned 's romp through australia 's outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered .
he begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners .
when he 's only 20 he forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds .
when ned 's mother ( clarissa kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3-5 years , ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother 's freedom .
when the authorities refuse , the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers .
rampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes , who do n't trust the traps ( police ) .
spoiler to follow in the next paragraph .
in the climax , kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police , but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured .
ned 's brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive .
but kelly 's gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys .
this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly 's call for justice .
jagger did n't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson .
the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian .
under richardson 's lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry .
if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch " mad dog morgan " ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly 's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner .

when i arrived in paris in june , 1992 , i was surprised to find france plastered with posters twin peaks : fire walk with me , since the movie was n't scheduled to open in the u . s . until late august .
happily , the film--the prequel to david lynch 's cult television series--was playing in a fancy , thx theater .
unfortunately , the theater was far more impressive than the movie , which absolutely stinks , much like a french lavatory .
worse , actually .
fire walk with me ( directed by lynch ) will be completely incomprehensible to anyone who has not seen the tv series or read " laura palmer 's secret diary . "
for " twin peaks " junkies , like me , the movie is only marginally improved .
the plot is jumbled and illogical , not to mention excruciatingly sluggish .
the first 30 minutes , which have almost nothing to do with the main story line , feature chris isaak and kiefer sutherland as fbi agents investigating a murder in portland , oregon .
the movie then stops in philadelphia for a nonsensical cameo by david bowie and a brief appearance by kyle maclachlan as dale cooper .
lynch then drops this plot strand altogether and abruptly shifts the setting to twin peaks , washington--one year later .
ah , twin peaks : " familiar territory , " you think to yourself as angelo badalamenti 's distinctive musical score chimes in .
wrong !
the movie proves that you really ca n't go home again , or at least lynch ca n't .
only about a quarter of the characters from the tv series appear in the movie : leland palmer , bobby briggs , james , shelly , leo , the log lady and a few others--mostly in meaningless cameos .
the rest of the " twin peaks " cast is nowhere to be seen , and consequently , lynch fails to recreate the spirit and flavor of tv 's most enigmatic town .
cast members michael ontkean , sherilyn fenn , piper laurie , and richard beymer are sorely missed , not to mention lara flynn boyle , who has been replaced by lackluster moira kelly in the crucial role of donna .
the movie concentrates solely on laura palmer ( sheryl lee ) as she suffers through drug abuse , prostitution , and incest , during her miserable last seven days on earth .
the night of laura 's death , which is truly terrifying , is the film 's only remotely effective sequence .
we finally get to see exactly what happened to laura after she jumped off james ' motorcycle and ran into the woods at that lonely traffic light in the middle of nowhere .
her murder unfolds just as agent cooper reconstructed it in the tv series , which is gratifying for faithful " twin peaks " viewers .
but it 's an awfully small reward for sitting through a painfully awful movie .

i wish i could have been in the pitch meeting for this ridiculous notion of a sports film .
i bet it was some hotshot warner brothers agent with an dark armani suit and manicured fingernails saying , " it would be a very light comedic version of any given sunday , and we could throw in the hoosiers angle with the casting of gene hackman as the tough but determined coach .
throw in that hunk of a guy keanu reeves and a cast of wacky characters and poof !
we 'll have a hit on our hands ! "
the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film , a mishmash collage of one-dimensional characters , rampant stereotypes of cultures and races , cliched emotional statements of purpose , and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography .
the story is loosely based around the pro football players ' strike in 1987 and a rag-tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels .
keanu reeves stars as shane falco , a has-been football college player looking for redemption .
gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers .
rounding out the cast includes swingers ' jon favreau , 7-up pitchman orlando jones , gruff owner jack warden , and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters : the drunken welshman , the overweight sumo wrestler , the black convict , the violent cop , and the dumb , dumb cheerleaders .
this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays , gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is , keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field , and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny 's .
the usual things happen like clockwork .
the hero rises from the ashes of failure , the team comes together in unity , the hero falls in love with a conventional love interest , the football games are won with enough schlock value to make the most ignorant of audiences cheer and clap , and the cheerleaders make you want to go home and watch late night movies on cinemax .
it 's also a shame when decent directors with good movies under their belts go to seed and become television and sequel hacks .
howard deutch , who was behind the camera for two of the best films of '80s - pretty in pink and some kind of wonderful , has since been doing grumpier old men and caroline in the city episodes .
obviously the problem is that without a good script , any director will fail in the end .
sports films are strong vehicles for cinematic glory , gritty tales involving the honor of men and the valiant efforts taken for the ultimate goal of victory in the face of insurmountable odds , the rise and fall of gallant heroes , and stories of dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life .
the replacements offers none of this .

can you say " dated " ?
you can if you 've seen rosemary 's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release .
" mystery science theater 3000 " has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the " good " ones too .
rosemary 's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success .
it all seems so harmless in the beginning .
mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed .
( there 's also a skull in the living room , but it 's only for decoration . )
their elderly neighbors pop in for a housewarming .
all 's well for about the first hour of this slow-moving film , until mia eats some of the neighbors ' chocolate mousse and passes out .
when she comes to , she finds herself in a darkened room with a bunch of people yelling and dancing like savages and a big , evil man raping her -- a foreshadowing of her future life with woody allen .
it seems like a dream and , when she finds herself pregnant , she almost forgets about it .
and everyone 's helping with the pregnancy .
the neighbors have some wonderful vitamin potions for her to drink , a good-luck charm for her to wear around her neck , and the name of an obstetrician who 's been in the business 66 . 6
years .
meanwhile , mia begins having chronic stomach pains and losing a lot of weight .
before too long she looks just like the lead singer of the cranberries .
that 's when you know your health 's failing .
the only person in the movie who 's the least bit suspicious of all this is an old friend ( maurice evans ) who calls mia up to give her the bad news -- and immediately falls into a coma .
by about the two-hour mark i felt the same way .
rosemary 's baby is way too long , and leads up to a payoff that 's about as boring and laughable as the rest of the movie .
i guess someone put a spell on this movie .

david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me .
it also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep .
lost and found marks the comedian 's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and it also reveals that when spade does n't have a reliable back-up system , his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect .
david spade is not the problem with lost and found .
he plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities .
the story revolves around dylan 's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack .
dylan believes that the best way to a woman 's heart is through her dog .
and so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over .
there are three good things about lost and found .
the first is spade .
the second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who 's been planted into the wrong movie .
lastly , there 's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there 's something about mary .
unfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute .
this kind of physical humor is dead .
pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel .
this is where i start to get fuzzy .
also in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila .
given the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow .
and , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ?
predictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated .
david spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing .
there are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny .
patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money .
jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles .
despite a few positive attributes , lost and found just does n't work .
if you 're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it 's trying to present .

the yet-to-be-released krippendorf 's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but buyer beware .
this movie ca n't make up its mind .
is it a family comedy with vulgar references to both the male and female bodies , menstruation , circumcision , and sex that would make any parents squirm at the thought of having their child next to them ?
or is it an adult comedy approached with such immaturity that only adolescents will appreciate the effort ?
either way , " unbalanced " is the word to stamp on this hit and miss and miss and miss effort .
the premise is catchy - widowed anthropology professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) has spent the past two years " getting over " the death of his wife , neglecting key research and squandering grant money on personal living expenses .
now it 's time to show what he 's achieved in those two years , and he has absolutely nothing to show for it .
with a fabricated tale of studying a previously undiscovered tribe in new guinea , krippendorf petitions for new funds while hiding the fact that the previous $ 100 , 000 grant was spent on trips to mcdonald 's .
but when his " discovery " becomes the latest craze among colleagues , the professor finds he must do more than talk about the tribe - he must create it .
with the aid of his three children , the headstrong teen shelly ( natasha lyonne of everyone says i love you ) , the slightly younger mickey ( gregory smith ) , and the nine-year-old edmund ( carl michael lindner ) , the " shelmikedmu " tribe ( named from the first half of each child 's name ) is born , and videos quickly produced in krippendorf 's backyard are passed off as stunning documentary footage of the newly found new guinea tribe .
despite the professor 's wishes , the buzz surrounding his discovery only grows , due in greatest part to veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , an overly vivacious ( and voluptuous ) anthropologist who barges her way into the discovery and basically deems herself krippendorf 's main assistant .
hungry for recognition , micelli sets up interviews , lectures , etc . in an effort to make this the biggest sociological event in history , a sure fire way to go down in the history books .
krippendorf , on the other hand , is seeing himself go down a jail cell corridor , not in history books , and with each new lecture , he must come up with something impressive to unleash about the tribe - mating habits , domestic structure , etc . thru fumbling improvisation , and often some quick thinking from his oldest son , krippendorf makes it thru each new lecture , but only creates more and more interest in the highly unique tribe .
on the opposing end is krippendorf 's arch rival , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) , an arrogant professor whose jealousy drives her on a mission to disprove the existance of the non-existent tribe .
it 's a cute idea , and approached with a more subtle ( and mature ) style , krippendorf 's tribe could 've been a real winner .
sadly , the mostly-misfired toilet humor , overly comical musical score ( by bruce broughton ) , and sugar coated sentiments ( all the key ingredients of a " family comedy " ) just are n't the right tone for this film .
cut that crap out , add some razor sharp dialogue and witty sociological perceptions and you 've got a good start .
at the state it 's in now , you 've got something along the lines of medicine man meets mrs .
doubtfire meets dumb & dumber , and that 's not a concoction anyone should be overly anxious to try .
the overall product here is a highly forgettable cup of " average " , with a few laugh-out-loud moments and a great big gap in between them .
most of the characters are surprisingly two-dimensional , and the only one who seems to exhibit any real acting effort ( lyonne ) seems to go greatly unappreciated .
director todd holland has gone about making this film in all the wrong ways .
it 's stuck in limbo between disney family fare ( jungle 2 jungle ) and potentially hilarious adult comedy ( a fish called wanda ) .
it 's this unbalanced structure that really knocks it down a grade , and it 's a brutal drop .
a strong warning to parents : forget the impression given by advertisements , do you want to take your kids to a film that has a woman asking a man if he finds her attractive merely because she 's holding his penis ?
yes , it 's put that bluntly !
just be warned - this is merely one example of the many shocking subjects to be brought up in the film , and others might not be as tame .

plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wan na be rock singer who 's planning a bank heist .
mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy 's jazz club .
they 're tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption .
meanwhile wendy 's sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy 's late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues
the review : main problem first - about 2 % of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work .
unfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the " what the hell where they thinking " category that takes up 98 % of the rest .
but , hell , it 's not as if he 's the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller .
leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on .
though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut .
the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two .
which is unfortunately , the other main story is n't any great shakes either .
the second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled .
at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that did n't improve on repeated viewing .
there is no doubt that this film 's achilles heel is its script .
as for the rest of the cast , it 's a mixed bag .
john flaus , one of australia 's most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder .
although he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off .
dominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really is n't given a whole lot to do .
pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes .
i must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element .
cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo .
the bar is an oppressive red , like all of it 's patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night .
if only deborah parson 's script could have supported this idea better .
having two director 's ( colin south & john tatoulis ) does n't help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it does n't pull away to anything else .
it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance .
it has no reason to it ; it 's just bad direction .
and , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep , it 's tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it 's just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed .

capsule : a wild jungle woman and an 11-story gorilla are discovered in tibet and taken to hong kong where the gorilla escapes and causes havoc .
this is a laughable 1977 rip off of king kong ( 1976 ) , itself a rip-off .
production values are low and audiences seem to like the film mostly for derisive laughter .
, high -2 ( -4 to + 4 )
- directed by ho meng-hua .
- this film is provided to be a sort of laughing stock to finish the festival .
- an earthquake uncovers an 11-story tall gorilla in the himalayas .
a hunter , chosen because he just broke up with his girl and is at loose ends , gets sent to find the ape and finds a sort of female tarzan who controls the ape .
- evelyne kraft is the jungle girl in a leather bikini that she is pasted into so she always looks on the verge of bouncing out of .
- gorilla actor has no idea how gorillas move and suit is terrible .
nice miniature effects , however .
- has almost a music video inside it of jungle girl playing with animals like chi-chi the leopard .
- several places there is narrative that is nearly incoherent as if there are missing scenes and the viewer has to guess what happened in the interim .
- actual location shooting in mysore .
ape shown badly matted behind temple .
- combining of images usually pretty bad .
incompetent matching of film stocks .
- stock footage frequently used .
- gorilla brought to hong kong by greedy entrepreneur who really abuses the ape before it escapes and tears things up real good .

topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil 's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but do n't know how to end .
it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other .
there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz 's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay .
for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line .
the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them .
at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives .
this does n't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - " we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related " - but it 's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing .
unfortunately this level of honesty is n't maintained .
with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama .
such a disappointment after such a brilliant start .
the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive .
the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable .
a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film .
it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles .
that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock .
up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place .
while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it 's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film .
not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it .
this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film .
as stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average .
it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss .

the art of woo attempts to be one of those films like breakfast at tiffany 's in which the audience is rooting for some sweet , vulnerable , irresistible woman to work out her problems and to find happiness .
the problem is that helen lee who writes and directs seems to have written alessa woo ( played by sook-yin lee ) as neither sweet nor vulnerable and she is quite resistible .
alessa is a young woman who happens to be a brilliant art dealer in the toronto art scene .
this is some sort of alternate world art scene where people pay tens of thousands of dollars for paintings by talented beginners and dealers in these paintings fly back and forth to places like switzerland .
one of the most knowledgeable of the art dealers is alessa .
she also happens to be the center of adulation of her friends and every party has suitors camped outside her window .
next door to alessa moves struggling genius artist and native american ben crowchild ( adam beach ) .
he sees that behind the facade that there is really a sad little girl within alessa who really will not be happy with the rich art collector she is dating .
ben gets emotionally involved with alessa .
( as alessa so delicately puts it , " we were bosom buddies , now we 're fuck buddies . " )
but alessa will have to decide whether she wants love with ben or wealth with her rich suitor .
the real problem with the film seems to be helen lee 's inability to decide what she wants to be saying .
she undercuts nearly everything she wants us to believe about alessa .
alessa is looking for financial security but she makes decisions about large sums of money for her clients .
this appears to be a high profile and well-paid job .
we are supposed to care about alessa 's feelings , but she coldly refuses to visit her own ailing father .
alessa can not be portrayed as sweet and vulnerable if at an art auction she turns into our man flint .
this is a charmless romantic comedy that bets everything it has on the appeal of its main character and comes up double-zero .
i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

yeah , yeah , the advertisements did n't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook - sex .
neve campbell and starship trooper 's denise richards getting it on ?
ok !
yeah , it 's a decent two minutes of film erotica , but even if that 's your main interest in this film , there 's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes .
wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however .
nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing , or at least curious to see the next turn , throughout the entire movie .
but this fast-paced , razor-sharp turning of events does n't leave much time to enjoy the surprises .
we start off in a high-class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making .
guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) seems to catch the eye of every student , particularly kelly van ryan ( richards ) , daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts .
right off the bat , kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce " mr . lombardo " .
the fund-raiser car wash seems the opportune time , particularly when you wash your guidance counselor 's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you 'll be soaked from head to toe when you 're done .
on the weekend of the car wash , kelly 's attempts at seduction fall flat , and when they do , she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day .
naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations .
but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low-class , marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller ( campbell ) comes forth with a near identical story , also involving her trusted guidance counselor .
pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians , sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney , ken bowden , played by bill murray .
yes , that bill murray !
sound like a good , complete movie ?
yes , that alone could have been , but this is just the beginning .
in fact , the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film .
it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time .
by the time the movie finishes , you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable .
unfortunately , with so much going on , you 're not given enough time in one predicament to be as effectively shocked when a new twist comes about .
this is just one way director john mcnaughton fails to make this movie as fun as it could 've been .
the 113 minutes fly by , and although it never feels underdeveloped , this pretzel of storytelling could 've been much more richly realized had a slower pace been taken .
the acting is incredibly reminiscent of fox prime-time soap operas , which no , is not a good thing .
and it 's not just campbell , who happens to hail from the prime-time fox soap " party of five " , but everyone suffers from heavily melodramatic overtones .
dillon , who was so charming in his understated role in last year 's in & out , gives the best performance , and murray 's surprising appearance adds some comedic flare to the film .
in fact , if the whole movie had been promoted as a subtle comedy , even if it was the exact same film , i would actually give it a better grade .
that 's how cheezy it comes off .
but aside from these two , the rest offer nothing more than some good eye-full 's .
in the right hands , wild things could 've been a wickedly delightful , scrumptiously twisted thriller , but instead we get juvenile overuses of profanity and some very laughable displays of acting .
and what 's up with these people passing as high school students ?
i realize hollywood often casts older actors to play teenage roles , but when i realized it was n't supposed to be a college they were at , i had to snicker .
i wo n't lie - this is definitely a guilty pleasure .
as corny as it is , it 's got some interesting aspects and could deserve at least a " b " for effort .
but if you just want to admire denise richards , go for last year 's starship troopers , which was every bit as campy , but a million times better .
of course , if seeing her breasts is your most important goal , you 'll be right at home with wild things .
perhaps the wildest thing of all is that somebody actually looked at this and thought it deserved to be in theaters .

in 1990 , the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars , patrick swayze , demi moore , and whoopi goldberg .
eight years later , moore and goldberg 's careers are n't exactly thriving , but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same ca n't be said of swayze , who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog .
forget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games .
good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey .
along the way , jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station , evil truckers , and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists .
every so often , like at the end of a video game " level " or " stage , " the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf , fresh from the triumph of spice world ) , who wants to steal the cache of guns .
just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of who 's driving what , all of red 's vehicles , be it a pickup or a big rig , are painted--you guessed it--red .
i could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jack 's dream of having a nice home with his family , the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license , the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo ) , but they are of little importance .
all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal , for none of the highway chaos , as credibly staged as it is , is terribly interesting , let alone exciting .
once you 've seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time , you 've seen it every time .
as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment , the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; it 's that swayze has to reduce himself to such work .
while far from the best of actors , he is certainly not horrible , and he is a charismatic presence .
i do n't know if it 's his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog .
regardless , if he continues on this career track , could a tv series be far behind ?

much ado about nothing .
ah , how sweet the irony !
it 's accepted wisdom in some circles - among english literature nuts , mainly - that whenever a critic knocks shakespeare they are only doing so through ignorance .
he just does n't " understand " shakespeare , you will hear them say .
the bard 's work is apparently beyond criticism .
what a load of old cobblers .
if these arbiters of public taste think kenneth branaugh 's film of shakespeare 's " comedy " much ado about nothing is comedy in any modern sense of the word , it 's time to get a life .
get monty python .
get woody allen .
get john waters .
whatever .
just get a real taste of some clever , witty , risky comedy .
and banish this nonsense to where it belongs .
drama and tragedy was shakespeare 's strength .
to my sensibilities - and i 'm no stick in the mud - much ado about nothing resonates with no spark whatsoever .
no kidding : this film ranks among the most embarrassing two hours i have ever spent in a cinema in my 20 years of movie going .
the only thing that stopped me walking out was loyalty to my lady friend , as this was our day out and i had n't seen her in ages .
but boy , does she owe me one !
i wo n't spend too much time on the plot .
basically , we follow the trials and tribulations of two would-be couples - one young , the other older .
there 's some dark treachery amongst all this , but everyone is so awfully jolly that you 'd hardly know it .
mind you , there 's nothing wrong with the basic story .
good romantic comedies based on similar premises abound .
nothing wrong with most of the cast , either .
branaugh , emma thompson and denzel washington are all talented performers .
the problem is the script , or more accurately , shakespeare 's original text .
light comedy should n't be complex .
yet wrapped in elizabethan english , the dialogue becomes difficult to comprehend .
for this alone it will be a problem for modern audiences unschooled in shakespeare and in search of nothing more than a good , undemanding laugh .
the only laughs to escape my belly were brought on by the gloriously inept performance of keanu reeves , the actor once again miscast as a jealous half-brother or something .
but when dissected and understood , what it all boils down to is that this stuff is just so goddamn lame .
this is comedy so clean and nice and corny and so devoid of danger that it leaves this viewer totally cold .
ho , ho , ho , boy likes girl !
ho , ho , ho , men are such klutzes !
ho , ho , ho , she 's so awfully clumsy !
oh please !
there 's wit in here somewhere , i 'm told .
i call it pretentious .
something lightweight striving to be something sophisticated through clever wordplay .
in the end , it 's cringeworthy .
watching some of the cinema patrons around me collapse with laughter made much ado about nothing a very weird movie going experience .
comedy ?
bah , humbug !

here i sit at my computer about to write my review of the recent action comedy " bait " starring jamie foxx and david morse .
this is a review i do n't even want to write because i 'd just be laying the same criticisms on it that i would with any other so-generic-and-predictable-it 's-beyond-ridiculous piece of hollywood fluff .
if they 're not going to give us , the audience , just a little credit and put something together with half a brain , why should i waste my time and mental energy criticising it ?
last summer i took this same approach with my review of " the mummy , " in that review i just quoted phrases my reviews of other sub-par movies .
i think i shall do the same thing here but with a few less quotes ( not all are applicable ) .
i hope this goes to show you what i think of " bait " and why you can find out all you need to know about it without having to take a wild guess .
it 's genuinely unfunny ( i , and the other audience members only laughed once during the entire two hours ) , unoriginal and unthrilling .
it 's not so bad to the point where it 's fun to watch because of its badness and it 's no so bad you absolute loathe it and are pained by watching it , it 's just such a cliche in and of itself , that , uhh . . .
lost my train of thought .
anyways , here 's those quotes , enjoy !
" getting an audience 's attention right from the beginning plays a major role in how today 's films work .
we want to have something exciting to watch , not a slow build-up of a story ( god forbid ! ) , and this film plays right into the mainstream 's hands . . . "
- review of " armageddon . "
" it 's clear the film does n't want to waste time on reality and thus the attempt to establish plausability ( the most minimal amount necessary ) comes across as a half-assed effort .
supporting characters and shady sup-plots are introduced , but as is the case with films made up of a large cast of characters , only a handful have any real significance . . .
there 's a fine line separating homage from plagiarism . . . , " - review of " godzilla " ( 1998 )
" unfortunately , as is the case with most modern thrillers , once the film showed potential for authenticity and intelligence , the cliches and action sequences take over , " - review of " the jackal . "

seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater # 3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) .
[ theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture ]
there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .
they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .
watching " flubber " really clinched this idea for me , because it 's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .
it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story .
the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere .
we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist .
within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .
phillip 's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer 's disease - is n't this rather lowbrow comedy ?
he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids ' movie if i ever saw one ) .
we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he 's forgotten .
sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she 'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .
but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it 's no surprise the major conflicts here are related .
christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip 's ideas , but his woman too .
what 's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !
wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day .
one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .
the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .
it 's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .
unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing .
flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .
most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip 's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .
but it 's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .
all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that do n't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .
it 's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .
during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , " i think they might be cheating , " to which the referee replies , " there 's no rules about jumping too high . "
" predictable " does n't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point .
and it 's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it 's the way it 's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition .
not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears .
i 'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it 's almost forgivable when you realize they 're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .
it 's safe to say everything that could be bad about " flubber " is .
the only original element the film has is the world 's first romance between a machine and a human .
but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you wo n't .

you know something , christmas is not about presents .
it 's about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins .
at least that would seem to be the message of " the grinch , " which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores .
hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season .
you know the plot : there 's this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville .
down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas .
the movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children 's book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones .
it 's rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that 's the case when jones ' version is compared to ron howard 's .
the tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff 's soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing " mr . grinch " ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch 's wide , toothless grin .
by contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another .
first , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie .
young wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season .
she begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic .
cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) .
are we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ?
the grinch is n't even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch 's rival for martha 's affection .
not only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought .
the casting choices are n't any better than the screenwriting decisions .
jim carrey seems woefully miscast .
while his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role .
his accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from " south park . "
not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch 's home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style .
needless to say , his wise-cracking antics do n't quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate .
little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile .
she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding " santa " in her living room stealing the tree ) .
however , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge .
bottom line : when you 're stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind .

when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store .
masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read .
of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history .
given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of " trillions " and make a live-action masters movie .
let 's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie .
the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * would n't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they ca n't help but seem terrible .
it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars .
we have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that " deja vu " is too polite a term to use in describing it .
" blatant uninspired ripoff " would appear more appropriate .
tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either .
so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ?
yes , there is .
one incredible good reason .
his name is frank langella .
langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years .
here he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece .
dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper .
given this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision .
skeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right .
masters of the universe .
i remember loving it when i was eleven .
at twenty one it 's difficult to see why .
but , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder .
besides , this year marks the film 's 10th anniversary .
watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate .

underwater science fiction stays submerged
sphere a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman
one of the most unpleasant experiences that can occur in a movie theater is when a cast of fine actors end up in a film that wastes their talents .
you keep thinking what they might have accomplished with the time they squandered .
psychologist norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) is called to the middle of the pacific ocean to work with the survivors of a plane crash .
when he arrives at the site , he discovers that there is no plane , but rather an enormous spacecraft that has been sitting 1 , 000 feet below the surface for almost 300 years .
having written a paper for the bush administration on how to handle first contact , he is chosen to head up the team of scientists investigating the ship .
his group as outlined in his report , consists of beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician ; and ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist .
unfortunately it turns out that the writing was a blow-off project for goodman who did it for the money and named his then-colleagues to the team .
" after all , " he explains , " who reads government documents ? "
lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel .
once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo .
discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere .
when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds .
a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer .
" my name is jerry .
i am happy " flashes across the screen .
this is unsettling for the psychologist .
" what happens if jerry gets mad ? " he asks .
barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he ca n't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry .
then the situation turns bad .
deadly beasts appear from nowhere .
a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel .
lethal sea snakes attack goodman .
a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " .
the suspicious scientists turn against each other .
this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man 's science fiction film .
however even the finest ingredients do n't go very far in the hands of a chief who does n't seem to care about his product .
director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that does n't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes .
the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification .
it 's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances .
it does n't get any better when the action scenes begin .
while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat .
oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them .
after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened .
their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited .
even goodman and halperin 's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing .
her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing .
there 's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious .
when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what 's going to happen .
the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting .
chapter headings that divide the movie have no function .
the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos .
much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow .
although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it is n't .
even a science fiction film must be internally consistent .
there 's too much here that does n't make sense .
are the manifestations real ?
the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect .
a scene in the sub suggests that it 's illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it 's not .
not everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers .
where the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to .
even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll .
the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale .
after pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending .
it 's difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse .
following the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours .
the weak scenes could have been cut , but then there would n't have been much left .
the movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there 's nothing special on the screen .
we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm .
stealing from " alien " , " the abyss " and the disastrous " event horizon " , this film has learned nothing from them .
remarkably levinson and hoffman 's other currently showing film is " wag the dog " , a smart and entertaining piece of work .
this one could have been titled the same sans one word .

when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the '60s cartoon series of " mr . magoo , " special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay .
mr .
magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented .
in fact , they were wrong .
mr .
magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it 's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity .
it 's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas .
look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you 'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr .
magoo .
the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining .
the worst , mr .
magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be .
the first problem with mr .
magoo is the script .
despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr .
magoo is comically barren .
from beginning to end , there 's not a laugh to be found .
every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud .
you 'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that 's not the case .
i 've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures .
then there 's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) .
in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun .
lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr .
magoo .
even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we 're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but " top form " is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here .
this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation .
the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber .
the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often .
the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) .
matt keeslar portrays one of magoo 's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo .
the bumbling man 's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus .
most of mr .
magoo 's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick .
the cartoon violence level in this film does n't approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it 's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices .
there 's a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean 's recent , similar misadventure , it does n't hold up well .
then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo 's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby .
i 'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack .
tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop .
his chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) .
like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream .
it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr .
magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages .
the screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they did n't seem to be enjoying themselves .
when the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it .
her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words .
mr .
magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen .

when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , " dangerous liaisons for kids ! "
it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears ' 1988 masterpiece .
imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits .
and i was impressed .
in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie .
it 's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs .
i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they 're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined .
cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do .
i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be .
phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont .
wow .
is n't that a memorable name ?
i could just say it over and over again .
sebastian valmont .
it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich .
sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he ca n't have , no material object out of his reach .
he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips .
and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults do n't really exist .
the ones who do are irritating .
sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants .
since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons .
kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn .
but it 's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the " paradigm of chastity and beauty . "
so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) .
but -- dear god !
-- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove .
dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting .
cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting .
kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her .
she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons .
gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive .
witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character is n't the moral staple she 's supposed to be : sure , she wo n't have sex until she 's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible .
but i ca n't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness .
i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions .
and there 's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone .
true , he is bad , but it does n't help that he has no character to work with .
kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch .
the film fails in every other way , too .
first of all , nobody talks like this .
even the " intellectuals " i know do n't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering .
for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there 's no way we can join it .
cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene .
earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie .
so , if we hate them , then what 's the point of an extended sex scene ?
titillation , of course .
it ca n't even work under the pretense of " meaningful love scene , " because we hate the characters .
it 's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons .
kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears ' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [ spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) .
but kids do n't act like this .
nobody acts like this .
in his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements .
the result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it 's really deep and profound .
i 'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that does n't change the fact that it 's awful .

" deep rising " gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films .
while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring 's " anaconda " -- " deep rising " has no tongue to put in its cheek .
folks , we 're only a month into the new year , and already here 's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases .
most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen " titanic , " then maybe they 'd have known to stay home ) when it 's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature .
the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members .
a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby .
but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful .
the main problem with " deep rising " is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory .
the concept is " leviathan " meets " titanic , " with a dash of " speed 2 " thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? )
measure .
this monster is equal parts " 20 , 000 leagues under the sea " and " the relic , " knows how to open doors like the raptors from " jurassic park " and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in " anaconda . "
some of the attack sequences are straight out of " jaws " and " alien . "
a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of " alien resurrection . "
there 's even a jet ski chase like " hard rain . "
and the list goes on .
watching " deep rising " 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy .
williams is affable enough , but his finnegan just is n't believable .
an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as " goldeneye " 's killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o'connor , as finnegan 's mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast .
djimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december 's " amistad , " pops up in a brief part .
he needs to stay away from the water .
the movie 's final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur .
as if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate is n't bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you 're really asking for it ) , " deep rising " is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot .
and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship is n't out of the question .

plot : a separated , glamorous , hollywood couple must pretend to reunite for a press junket of the last movie that they ever shot together .
kewl . . . now
i only wish that i could pretend never to have seen this movie . . .
critique : trite , unfunny , boring and a waste of everyone 's talent .
how a premise with such zest and bite can turn into a movie that does n't feature any chemistry , any real laughs , any surprises or any spice is beyond me .
how julia roberts is used solely as a " puppy dog " character , puttering around in the background while we endure the complete bitchiness of zeta-jones ' character , who is not one bit funny or romantic ( two ideal ingredients in a " romantic comedy " ) , is also beyond me .
and why they chose john cusack , a great , quirky actor in his own right , to play the most bland , uninteresting and unfetching character ( with zero chemistry with either of his leads ) is further more , beyond me .
and to anybody who decided that this project was " funny " enough to greenlight featuring the talents mentioned above , along with billy crystal , christopher walker , seth green and stanley tucci . . . well ,
what can i say . . . i
just do n't have the words .
so is this the worst movie that i 've seen all year ?
no . but it definitely sucks and it 's basically because . . . well ,
it 's just not funny .
and for the record , allow me to state a few more problems with it .
it starts off slow , it 's got no energy , it does n't engage you with any of its characters ( julia barely gets somewhat interesting in the film , everyone else . . . lame ! ) , it utilizes way too many flashbacks to move the story forward , it 's utterly predictable , standard , routine , see-through and uninteresting as a plot and it just sits there on the screen , big and ugly , waiting . . . waiting for you to laugh or find something in it that is amusing .
and then hank azaria shows up . . . aaaaaah , the film 's savior ( mind you , some might be offended by his exaggeration of a stereotype , but that 's another story altogether ) .
but when an experienced " voice " actor upstages all of the main stars in a summer " blockbuster " romantic comedy with an over-the-top antonio banderas accent , damn dude . . . your
film 's in trouble ! !
rent this movie on video just to see what went wrong yourself .
the references to ricky ricardo and senor wences ( huh ! ? ) , the idio-plot points like when one of the characters goes on the roof to stretch his arms out and relax , but everyone believes that he 's going to kill himself ( hardy-har-har ) and the cheap way of getting the audience to leave the theater laughing by bringing back a ball-sniffing dog that has no place being in the location at the end of the movie , well . . . i
could go on .
but i wo n't because i do still respect all of the actors in this film and actually did laugh at azaria , green and tucci 's antics from time to time ( ironic , eh . . . what
about the leads , dammit ! ) and liked the premise behind the film ( before i saw the finished product , of course ) .
a dud all the way around .
btw , all the talk about this film was that julia roberts was to be in a fat suit for one scene ( her character is supposed to have lost 60 pounds ) , so when the scene finally came , i did get a little excited about what it might look like and then . . . well ,
it basically just looked like julia roberts in a fat suit !
ugh .
i think i 'm gon na start drinking again after this lame-ass movie .
c'mon hollywood , enough with the crud !
where 's joblo coming from ?
beautiful ( 1/10 ) - my best friend 's wedding ( 7/10 ) - notting hill ( 5/10 ) - pretty woman ( 7/10 ) -runaway bride ( 5/10 ) - someone like you ( 4/10 ) - wedding planner ( 3/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you 've got mail ( 4/10 )

roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , " who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .
ben kingsley ? "
my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .
they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .
the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .
that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .
gary " gal " dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .
life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .
but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .
the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .
the second punch comes from gal 's past .
back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv 's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .
he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .
don will accept any decision gal makes from " yes " to " certainly . "
however , if gal says " no " don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy 's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .
in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody 's skin .
kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .
there are some serious problems in louis mellis 's and david scinto 's script that should have been caught before filming .
when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .
beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .
any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .
additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .
no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .
in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .
i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .
the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .
the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .
it is not a great plot .
in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .
perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .
it is an old plot dressed up to look new .
if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .
this is director jonathan glazer 's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .
his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .
cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .
we see one side of a person 's faces .
but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .
half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .
us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .
at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .
sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .
the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .
further respectability comes from ben kingsley 's high-powered performance .
i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to + 4 scale .

> from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong .
at reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world .
courtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school .
everyone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity .
courtney is the " leader " of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group .
it is liz 's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz .
just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else .
and also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four do n't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie .
and finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth .
this time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney 's group , as well as the entire school .
> from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing .
not only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast .
judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has .
also on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers .
on the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but does n't match her wickedly clever performance as " tatum " , in 1996 's scream .
mcgowan 's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film .
she is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her .
faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles .
when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles .
gayheart is n't given as much to do here as she was in 1998 's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker .
jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in .
we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that do n't have anything to do with the actual film .
the beginning and ending are strong , it 's just the middle that needs a lot of help .
during the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion .
nothing to grab the viewer 's interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again .
jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat .
the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang .
all in all , a horrible disappointment .
the bottom line : the tagline reads , " even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside . "
yes , that is too true .
no matter how good this film may have looked , it fails to deliver .

` the skulls ' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of ` the firm ' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor .
certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter .
i chuckled incessantly , all the way home .
let me share .
the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i 'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) .
luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report .
despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization .
soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $ 20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account .
yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ?
but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable .
the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense .
unfortunately , ` the skulls ' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting .
it 's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . .
but not the script .
` the skulls ' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers .
first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm .
afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar .
will they never take this watch off ?
and what if they forget it by their bedside ?
perhaps their ? secret ' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed .
on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters .
gee , why not member t-shirts ?
but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree ' or ? disagree ' notions when making collective decisions .
they are given official skull paddles .
when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal .
facing the opposite way means a disagreement .
would n't they merely express themselves verbally ?
hell no .
they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong .
i 'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest .
the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the ` dawson 's creek ' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout .
but not entirely .
accomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them .
and then there 's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor .
mcdonald 's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) .
i pray it was a ` snatch-the-paycheck-and-run ' exercise for all these actors .
the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better .
let 's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character .
paul walker , the strapping quarterback from ` varsity blues ' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge 's son .
walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( ` dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) .
some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke 's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics .
it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one .
or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style .
it makes you wonder why he did n't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like ` dragonheart ' and the moderate stallone thriller ` daylight ' are n't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash .
aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , ` the skulls ' gets little accomplished .
the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical .
the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick .
instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage .
we 've seen it all before , and better .
` the skulls ' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ? boneheaded ' seems just too generous .

at the outset of swordfish , john travolta 's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today .
basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers .
how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture .
swordfish is loud , violent and amoral .
it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life .
and how does travolta 's gabriel plan to do this ?
by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists .
swordfish is a very cynical movie .
it relies on an audience 's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration .
the movie 's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you 'd actually see how ridiculous it all is .
this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it 's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions .
the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government 's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign .
talk about whacked-out patriotism .
my objections to swordfish are many .
the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort .
it 's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits .
another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife .
stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl .
audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband 's adult films .
thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve .
in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed .
then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel 's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley 's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel .
children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films .
there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well .
yea , it 's only make believe , but that does n't mean you have to tolerate it .
travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel .
his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off .
jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings .
his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database .
his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate .
halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel 's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel .
swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel .
viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain .
and maybe that is the movie 's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive .
and that is not enough .
this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .

i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas .
with the overt success of the three original star wars films , lucas has become , not necessarily a filmmaker , but the head cheeze at a huge toy company , with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve .
only this toy was made for $ 115 million , but every kid wants it , and , like all other expensive toys , falls apart within an hour after playing with it .
the product in question , star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! ) , is pure and simple : its about the money , baby !
no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it would n't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release .
i come to the sw franchise as a stranger , since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular .
i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy .
phantom menace is like the first sw , minus 10 .
nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable .
even the special effects seem rather bland .
the story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the
acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game .
sw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far .
with a title like sw e1 : tpm , lucas has one big head on those shoulders .
i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie , although , that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours .
pm is one long headache .

remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ?
" pulp fiction " and " fargo " both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter .
that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing " the way of the gun " that at first glance looks like another of those wan na-be 's but upon closer inspection does n't look like anything comprehendable .
it 's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that wo n't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous .
complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who 's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote " the usual suspects , " which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim .
that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings .
you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that " if it 's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . "
with " the way of the gun " mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped .
the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but are n't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) .
they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization .
they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom .
along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the " bag man " ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he 's doing ) .
the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously ca n't call the authorities for help .
his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers ' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back .
the exec 's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right .
meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all .
mcquarrie does n't know the meaning of the word simple .
he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie .
everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it 's to the point of surrealism .
nothing is what it seems in this reality , it 's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry 's rules and regulations .
every scene with caan 's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about " the business " and how it works and we 're hardly given a clue as to what they 're talking about .
these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they 're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet 's trash .
no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality .
it 's like a dream without any appeal .
take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff .
they sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they do n't move .
the guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them .
you 'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they do n't , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob .
there 's a lot of things i did n't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes is n't some yuppie or old rich snob , he 's like a hippie straight out of the 60s .
secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed .
lastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country 's army .
if they were suicidal they would n't have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) .
there 's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility .
what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is .
absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable .
and it 's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time .
with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it .
i ca n't say either for " the way of the gun , " because it has very little going for it and i ca n't imagine anyone intelligently defending it .

capsule : dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes , and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones .
basic instinct 's worst crime is that it 's not just a bad movie , but in many ways , an incompetent one as well .
it 's stupid in itself , and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is .
it 's supposed to be a thriller , but the plot is dead on its feet , and ultimately arbitrary ; it 's only put into the movie to jerk us around .
it 's also supposed to be sexy , but it 's instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures .
it 's a ripoff .
the story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm .
the biggest suspect is an authoress , catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) , who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged .
or maybe it 's the work of a copycat ?
these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who 's on the case ( michael douglas ) , who has a few problems himself .
like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor .
we can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance .
joe eszterhas has written the screenplay , and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge : the killer 's identity is kept a secret until the movie 's final shot .
this is n't in itself a problem -- the problem is that up until that point , we 've been given nothing to work with .
every clue in the movie -- every clue -- is ambiguous .
the whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill .
red herrings , dead plot threads , violence , and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets .
they add up to zip , because they 're not happening to people we care about .
douglas 's character is foulmouthed and bitter and that 's it ; stone 's character has an iron-on smile that never changes ; the rest are forgettable .
when we do n't even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie , who cares what happens in it ?
especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying , but in many ways inexplicable ?
( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : " if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know , or would * care * to know , just leave ! " )
one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone 's life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with .
i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment ; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big-budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism ?
</text>
<text>
for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers .
apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer does n't change a thing , since body of evidence was n't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it .
in other words , it 's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid .
madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp .
she 's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover .
already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie can not be sexual unless she 's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men .
what 's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well .
madonna 's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition .
( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy .
this movie leave no scummy stone unturned . )
anyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna 's sexuality .
how do we know this ?
because his character is set up with the token wife and kids .
how obvious is it that he 's gon na cheat on her and have to fess everything up ?
and get kicked out of the house ?
and get welcomed back anyway ?
do n't skip to the end yet ; we 're just getting warmed up .
dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie .
most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who do n't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs .
do n't ask .
another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it 's insanely dull .
what 's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes .
the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes .
the thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor .
and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ?
-- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in .
the director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this is n't a meal ticket , it 's leftovers .

a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i 've ever reviewed on paper .
i did n't know at the time that i 'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer .
as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and is n't very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion .
the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then " the vorld " ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah .
but morals are not the point of this film--topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is .
the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls .
since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ?
only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he 's in a real movie .

play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie .
containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men ca n't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two .
rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . .
something that he has not yet successfully achieved .
rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince 's ex-girlfriend , grace .
both men are nearing the end of their " almost " careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity .
when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement .
our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is " promised " a shot at a future title fight .
the film is divided into two sections .
at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace 's " sassy grassy " green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day .
along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .
once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar .
both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we 'd know it from their work here .
mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince .
the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable .
mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar .
weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance .
the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another .
tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who ca n't make her mind up which boxer she prefers .
because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins .
but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other .
writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed .
if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film .
as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable .
the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .
the phrase , " play it to the bone ' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you 've achieved your desired goal .
that is a biblical principle .
" know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ?
so run , that ye may obtain . "
1 corinthians 9 : 24 [ kjv ]
achieving anything worthy in life requires " playing it to the bone " .
we need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives .
this is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives .
as a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time .
but as a principle of life , the phrase " play it to the bone " are words to live by .

as far as " mystery men " is concerned , the burning question is less " is it really as bad as it looks from the trailer ? "
( the answer there is an unequivocal " yes " ) and more " how in the name of sweet jesus did first-time director kinka usher get such a first-rate cast to act in this muck ? "
" mystery men " features greg kinnear as the heavily-sponsored captain amazing and geoffrey rush as his arch nemesis ( singular ) casanova frankenstein .
a veritable police lineup of hot hollywood talent plays the superhero wannabes of the title , who join forces to get c . amazing out of a tight spot when c . frankenstein puts the screws on champion city .
there 's william h . macy as the mild-mannered shoveler , hank azaria as the cutlery-flinging blue raja ( no knives , but a phony english accent that 's just as sharp ) , ben stiller as mr . furious ( whose only power seems to be his ability to get hot under the collar ) , janeane garofalo as a crazed bowler with her father 's skull interestingly preserved , wes studi as a rhetoric-spouting cowled avenger , and kel mitchell as the token ( and , adding insult to injury , invisible ! )
black guy .
bringing up the rear , so to speak , is paul reubens ( yes , that 's pee wee herman paul reubens ) as . . .
well , let 's just call him the gas man .
the production design is overblown , the special effects are overdone , and the script ( based on bob burden 's " dark horse " comic book series ) is overbaked .
the appealing actors are uniformly good and stiller is even stellar , but they ca n't begin to save " mystery men " --it 's just one big mess .
you 're better off renting the video and pressing fast-forward to get to the funny bits .
i believe i counted three .

plot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music .
one day , he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g . i . , but first , he must get a sex change ( enter hedwig ) .
once married , the two move to the states , but quickly thereafter , get a divorce .
at that point , hedwig starts writing music and meets another confused boy , who soon turns into a star .
that boy also turns his back on hedwig , and it is n't long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants .
this is the story of his/her life , told via flashbacks and musical numbers .
critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell , does n't really come together as a whole , with over-the-top symbolism , incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through .
in fact , this is n't so much of a realistic , articulate , behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock 'n roll star , as it is an ambiguous , overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man , his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet .
i guess that i was expecting the former going in .
the film is somewhat interesting to a point , but i was personally never able to involve myself too much , as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant .
but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience .
chances are that if you are a fan of the wall , the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla , queen of the desert , the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point , and provide the lyrics of their song , on-screen ) .
well , i personally do n't care for those films , and did n't really get into the whole " show " atmosphere of this movie either .
i guess i might 've looked at it all too literally , but like i said earlier , i just did n't care enough about the characters to delve into the " so the butterfly represents his freedom ? "
side of things .
all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and did n't make me feel any more fulfilled .
what was hedwig 's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ?
what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ?
( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? )
what ever happened to the lawsuit ?
and more . . .
all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat .
if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that 's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well .
i did n't get it .
the film 's humor also did n't tickle my funny bone either .
then again , i 've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen .
some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added " atmosphere " of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience .
but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i did n't leave the theater very satisfied .
i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers .
i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene .
note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single " mainstream " critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself .
but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the " official " critics , while i , a regular " joblo " in the audience , just would n't get what all the fuss was about .
this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews .
where 's joblo coming from ?
moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love 's labour 's lost ( 8/10 )

wyatt earp details thirty-five years in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900 .
after seeing the movie speed twice recently , i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatt 's life pass before my eyes in real time .
this movie was boring , slow , boring , and slow .
there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat .
the script happily woman-bashes but also tries to sound like an 80s movie .
they can not have it both ways .
" i now pronounce you husband and wife . "
sure , they said that in the 1800s .
" entrepreneur . "
sure .
every bit of male-ego-stroking dialogue that wyatt 's third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it .
" oh , the script was written by two men ? "
" no kidding ! "
the movie is torture to sit through .
the scenery is boring .
the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important .
can you say poor editing ?
everyone looks ugly in this movie .
when you shoot people from under their chins , they look like they have double chins .
kevin costner has never looked worse .
he should sue .
he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost .
dennis quaid is marvelous .
if you have to see this movie just for his performance , go into the theatre at the movie 's halfway mark .
doc holliday ( quaid 's character ) shows up at about the 90-minute mark .
gene hackman is very good .
is he in the credits ?
i do n't remember seeing his name .
mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatt 's second wife .
annabeth gish is good as wyatt 's first wife .
i though that jamie gertz played wyatt 's third wife , but i later heard that her name is joanna going .
she looks great but her dialogue sucks .
she also seems way to young for costner .
costner seems way to old for 90 % of this movie .
in his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old .
yeah , right .
catherine o'hara and jobeth williams are always good and totally wasted here .
this is the worst movie that i have seen in years .
the last action hero was better that this .
go see maverick if you want to see a western .
bullets for dennis quaid 's performance only .

america loves convenience .
after all , we 're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control .
yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far .
ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin ' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve " demolition " williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home .
when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed " the commander , " " the rookies , " and the guy with the cool accent discover the town 's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents ' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches .
filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences .
the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story .
ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose .
attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced .
most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube .
with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to " me and my brother when we was kids . "
apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment .
but , even in the film 's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite .
yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt .
and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand .
characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ?
as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed .
eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson .
what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns ca n't handle .
explosions are fun .
and even if the nukes do n't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will .
in the end this film defines itself when our cop 's tribunal pronounces , " is that all you have to tell us ? "
for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story .

the second serial-killer thriller of the month is just awful .
oh , it starts deceptively okay , with a handful of intriguing characters and some solid location work .
after a baby-sitter gets gutted in the suit- ably spooky someone 's-in-the-house prologue , parallel stories unfold , the first involving a texas sheriff ( r . lee emery ) , a gruesome double murder , and the arrival of a morose fbi agent ( dennis quaid ) on the eve of voting for the local lawman 's reelection .
the second pairs a hitch- hiker ( jared leto ) with a friendly former railroad worker ( danny glover ) .
they 're headed west , toward the rockies and away from the murder scene .
which one is the killer ?
well , it does n't really matter , 'cause when writer/first-time director jeb stuart ( die hard ) finally spills the beans , you wo n't take his choice seriously anyway .
the whole thing goes south about an hour in , with the tale taking hairpin turns that i certainly could n't follow .
and through the whole thing there 's quaid , playing with the most intense monotony this side of steven sea- gal .
i guess i 'm glad that i did n't walk out-- there 's some nice train stuff at the end and a fun nod to dr .
strangelove .

for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess .
in the early to mid 1400 's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman .
the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place .
france was involved in " the hundred years war " against england .
there was no strong political leadership in the country .
morale was low , there being little hope for the future .
it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing " voices " and seeing " visions . "
convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him .
the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown .
he does . . .
and she does .
then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors .
director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material .
the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable .
his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role .
ms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse .
if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant .
since it is n't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part .
her joan is unbalanced , " inspiring " the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed .
john malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii .
an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death .
faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin 's mother-in-law and chief advisor .
the army under joan 's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers .
the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan 's arrival .
trying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan 's insistence on following her " visions . "
dustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan 's conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial .
dressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her " revelations . "
as well she should .
scriptures do speak of revelation .
god , via his gift of holy spirit , is able to communicate to men .
three of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation .
they are : word of knowledge , word of wisdom , and discerning of spirits .
even the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his " holy men . . .
who spake as they were moved by holy spirit ( i . e .
by revelation . ) "
but the scriptures also caution us :
" beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world . "
1 john 4 : 1 [ kjv ]
joan 's end , ( being burned at the stake at the age of 19 ) , the frenzy ( mob rule ) and blood lust her inspiration wrought , and the death , pain , or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one .
while her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality , she was , as others have been before and since , misled by the spiritual master of deception .
as a messenger , she was quite effective .
she was just confused as to whose message she was carrying .

this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation .
but lo and behold , here comes " switchback , " and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as " kiss the girls " and " i know what you did last summer . "
but " switchback " is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting .
" switchback " opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she 's watching .
we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while .
he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest does n't keep him from offering pursuit .
lacrosse 's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man .
in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado .
along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) .
this tangent is n't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself .
or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about .
in a sense , that 's half of the basic problem with " switchback . "
for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we 're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we 'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction .
but " switchback " then decides to explicitly reveal the killer 's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense .
some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves .
what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ?
and dennis quaid ?
( that monotone -- stop it ! )
ermey is solid in a supporting role that 's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes ' object of affection in " my so-called life " ) is a scene-stealer tried and true .
> from a material standpoint , " switchback " is pretty empty .
but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote " the fugitive " and " die hard " ) does n't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals .
the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor .
still , that 's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie 's look will end up leaving you cold .

before the remake of psycho appears , we 've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder .
as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing .
the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun ' in an loft apartment .
the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair .
if i was paltrow , though , i 'd definitely go with mortensen .
less wrinkles .
anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he 'll pay him to kill his lovely wife .
mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses .
unfortunately , the film dose n't progress very fast .
in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . )
the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts .
not too good for a 'thriller . '
also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par .
paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie .
mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role is n't meaty enough to show all his talent .
which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does .
however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside .
also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective .
again , it 's not a character we 're seeing on the screen , it 's david suchet .
the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in 's , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting .
however , looks ca n't save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway .
the screenplay is o . k , but there 's some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched .
the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel .
with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment .
there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between .
the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you would n't be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder .
overall rating =

shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen .
it is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies .
that is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort .
shakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work .
the finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books .
philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london .
it is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan .
however , to directly quote the film , he has " cash flow problems . "
through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts .
so , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production .
however , the young writer has a severe case of writer 's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well .
he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate 's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but ca n't seem to put words to paper .
then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer 's block .
there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing .
the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it 's author .
ironically , that could n't be truer here .
the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors .
one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love .
so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character 's name in the credits .
the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth 's theatres .
joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though .
he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad .
gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well .
however , the supporting cast does almost save the day .
geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking .
they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links .
you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon does n't qualify as real acting . ) .
and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well .
but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances .
when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained .
however , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it is n't necessarily quality .
and this certainly is n't quality .
perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work .
simply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .

i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 .
the best way i can put it is that it 's funky .
i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of " police academy 4 : citizens on patrol " , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song " citizens on patrol " during the opening credits ?
it 's just like that .
anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) .
this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed .
it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me .
she 's the lone survivor this time .
part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects .
jason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he 's completely bald .
also , it being one day later , it ca n't be friday the 13th now can it ?
oh well .
steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series .

tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning .
however , they wo n't find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either .
joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt .
his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she 's a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) .
sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on-again , off-again relationship with joe 's best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) .
however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he 's always pursued : a real blonde .
there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough .
the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara 's perfume ads : " depression - it 's not just a state of mind " .
but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel .
and , unfortunately , the film 's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic .
take for example the film 's framing device of an old lady and her dog .
the story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie .
matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they 're stuck in the most boring plotlines .
modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor .
keener 's character has a stronger edge , but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense .
the movie 's running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it .
there 's just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama .

ahh yes .
the teenage romance .
an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl .
and with the arrival of the breakout hit ` she 's all that ' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including ` 10 things i hate about you ' and ` drive me crazy ' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity .
along now comes ` down to you ' .
the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid ` she 's all that ' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all .
only ` down to you ' does n't have the ? unlikely scenario ' mentioned above .
it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we 're accustomed to .
this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing .
in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) .
they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies .
from here , it 's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story .
the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . .
well , only happen in the movies .
fortunately , the cast of ` down to you ' has a certain appeal .
freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around .
zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film 's intelligent dialogue .
rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( ` the faculty ' ) , selma blair ( ` cruel intentions ' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv 's ` that 70 's shows ' ) .
even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al 's dad , the host of the popular cooking program ` chef ray ' .
maybe the concept of ` down to you ' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd .
as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely .
perhaps worst of all , ` down to you ' is not funny .
the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired .
the characters on screen , often laughing at each other 's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience .
even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it 's course .
the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called ` cooks ' , a ` cops ' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy ' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) .
when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired .
in order to make a teen comedy work , you 've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity .
` 10 things i hate about you ' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing .
no such luck with ` down to you ' .
it 's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end .
and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . .
only in the movies ' .

at times , you 'd think edtv would be an entertaining film .
i mean , who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day ?
but this average joe , ed perkuny , ( matthew mcconaughay ) , is a sappy , lifeless creation that wanders around , trying to solve everyone 's problems and settle his own .
mcconaughay is awful , especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans .
frankly , he had more charm in the devestating flop the newton boys .
he overacts in every way : his overexaggerant body language , obsession with kissing women every second he gets the chance , and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life , and drops to his knee and cries .
the rest of the cast is very good ; especially martin landau ( as ed 's step-father ) , who plays a cute role as the close-to-death old guy that makes all the witty comments .
jenna elfman is good , ( but a little overemotional ) ; her main problem is that she keeps getting sucked into bad films , i . e .
ca n't hardly wait , and krippendorf 's tribe .
woody harrelson , as ed 's brother ray , does his usual egg-headed role , with his comic wit as well ( he wrote a book entitled , " my brother pissed on me . " )
elizabeth hurley is perfectly cast as the easy slut , and dennis hopper , in a quick cameo as ed 's biological father , is a nice choice ( ironically coming after the role he turned down as christof in the truman show ) .
ellen degeneres stood out as the executive who , after awhile , decides the show must not go on much to the opposite of the head exec , rob reiner 's opinion .
i hate to compare this film to the truman show , but the fact is , i was ashamed to see this movie .
it felt that i had dropped from college to kindergarten after seeing truman and ed .
edtv had no real wit or genius ; it was typical hollywood .
extracting the tv part of the movie , you have the simple plotline : man steals brother 's girlfriend , girlfriend leaves town , man gets new slut girlfriend to feel like he can move on , slut breaks up with him , real girlfriend comes back , and voila , you have a romance .
i got so restless during this movie , i almost walked out .
the only reason it does n't drop below a " c " grade is because of the fine supporting performances .
ad2am " i almost lost my nose . . . and
i like it .
i like breathing through it . "

there 's a good , and timely , story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first , a new movie about the abuses of our prison system .
with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy , this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies--a point of view .
but director marc rocco makes it clear from the beginning that pretentious , often nauseating , camera movements and slick , mtv- style lighting and editing are far more important .
there 's not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling .
and everything suffers .
christian slater and kevin bacon star as defense attorney and alcatraz inmate , respectively .
after spending an unprecedented amount of time in an isolated cell for attempting to escape , bacon murders another prisoner and faces trial .
his young lawyer ( slater ) is fresh out of law school but determined to " put alcatraz on trial " for the abuses of it warden ( gary oldman ) .
the result is the usual courtroom theatrics- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students .
there 's very little to praise here outside of kevin bacon 's earnest overacting and the appropriate story .
there 's a lot of overacting from everyone--you know you 're in trouble right away when r . lee ermey ( the drill sergeant in full metal jacket ) is cast as a judge , the center of reason and moderation .
slater has never been convincing and certainly is n't here and oldman is on a bad streak of hammy performances .
but the worst feeling you get while watching murder in the first is that the man behind the camera could care less about telling a good story .
there are long exchanges of dialogue where the camera is not even moving near the characters , let alone with them .
how frustrating it must be for actors to work under these conditions .
if there 's anything that has alway distinguished american films over the rest of the world , it is our ability to tell a good story .
have we forgotten ?

" you damn dirty apes ! "
that 's just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes that 's taken on a comedic context over time .
no one back then seemed to realize how over-the- top charlton heston 's acting style was , but it shows now , particularly in this " mystery science theater 3000 " wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time , actually winning one oscar ( for makeup , no less ) and being nominated for a couple others .
it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes , escape from the planet of the apes , return of the planet of the apes , beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes , planet of the apes : the next generation , police academy of the apes . . .
the list goes on .
heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth .
the thing is , on this planet humans ca n't talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species .
heston 's companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned .
he surprises them all with his gift of speech , making two primate scientists ( roddy mcdowall and kim hunter ) believe heston is the missing link between ape and man .
believe me , we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years .
when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans ) , it is received as heresy , for all good monkeys know god " created ape in his image . "
but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species , before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president .
and he takes them there , holding up a baby doll and yelling , " if humans could n't speak , then how do you account for this talking doll ? ! "
and how do you account for your acting ability , mr . heston ?
the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movie 's surprise conclusion .
i wo n't reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling " god damn you all to hell ! "
several times in succession .
the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them .
what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony , a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution .
but let me tell you , if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges ( heston [ to female ape ] : may i kiss you before i go ?
ape : but . . .
you 're so . . .
ugly . ) , he 'd convert to creationism on the spot .
luckily for us , science-fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good .

claire danes , giovanni ribisi , and omar epps make a likable trio of protagonists , but they 're just about the only palatable element of the mod squad , a lame-brained big-screen version of the 70s tv show .
the story has all the originality of a block of wood ( well , it would if you could decipher it ) , the characters are all blank slates , and scott silver 's perfunctory action sequences are as cliched as they come .
by sheer force of talent , the three actors wring marginal enjoyment from the proceedings whenever they 're on screen , but the mod squad is just a second-rate action picture with a first-rate cast .

a big , busy boxing satire with a surprisingly paltry punch , the great white hype stars samuel l . jackson as a shameless boxing promoter whose plan to boost sagging pay-per-view revenues is to " invent " a white contender ( peter berg ) to challenge his black heavyweight " champ " ( damon wayans ) .
( the logic is that people will pay more to see black vs . white than black vs . black . )
he may be right , in an absurdly accurate way , but the film does n't give us a reason to care .
as a scathing sports spoof , hype is just that : unfunny , unfocused , and , at times , just plain pointless .
as a commentary on race relations , it 's even * less * effective .
the dialogue is the best of this mess , lines like jon lovitz exclaiming " i can not make caviar out of fish eggs ! "
writers tony hendra and ron shelton also do good on the street slang , though we never hear enough of it .
the script is n't strong enough , though , to support the aggressive camera work of director reginald hudlin ( house party ) .
he comes across as absolute overkill .
the great white hype * almost * turns around at the end , at the big match , when hudlin attempts an extended gag of rock-concert proportions .
with costumed dwarfs , gangsta rappers , and the " champ " dressed as death , only then do we get a glimpse of the spoof that should 've been .

as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood does n't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions .
this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) .
they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges ' life by shooting an unarmed pow .
that 's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances .
certainly hodges is not complaining .
years pass .
hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer .
childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould .
because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops .
childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command .
after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd .
more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down .
childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians .
he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film .
did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ?
or are there simply no rules in war ?
the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions .
the murder of 83 " innocent civilians " has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ?
where is the u . n . ?
the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ?
this film ( in a way akin to films such as " a few good men " ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism .
these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair .
what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking .
one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement ' is its lack of credibility .
the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed .
a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality .
that is precisely why it 's not offensive .
it is completely unobjective .
many stories are started and never finished .
many questions are asked , but never answered .
a lot of parallels are referring to nothing .
it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film .
is it about arab mentality ?
america 's foreign policies ?
america 's role in the world ?
corruption in the higher circles ?
it goes on and on .
it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot .
it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one .
i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin 's probably most acclaimed film was " the exorcist " which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film .
in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film .
though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage .
i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed .
it 's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe .
the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict .
even the actors can not save this film from going under .
though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of .
they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back .
jackson is gray and jones uninteresting .
the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks .
the time has come for the verdict .
on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty .
on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty .
but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it 's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population .
i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys .
this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth .
however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states .
and that it 's not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert .

jet li busted onto the american action movie scene , when he stole the show in 1998 's lethal weapon 4 , with his wicked looks , his nasty moves and his undeniable charisma .
it only took another two years for mega-producer joel silver to set him up in an all-american movie , primed to take over some of the empty action-hero seats left by alleged coke-head van damme and that pudgy guy named steven seagal .
would this film take li past his rival asian action counterparts , namely chow yun-fat and jackie chan ?
let 's find out .
plot : rival chinese and black gangster organizations fall further out of favor from one another , when members of their respective families start turning up dead .
that 's when badass jet li blasts into the picture to find out who the men were behind his brother 's death and to exact some of his own style of revenge .
critique : three words : not enough action !
simple enough ?
not enough hong kong kickass jet li action to compensate for a horribly predictable screenplay , bad actors , crappy dialogue and oh-so many over-the-top melodramatic moments .
and a romance angle ?
why , one must ask . . . why ?
i love fight scenes and i really dig jet li too , but this little ditty barely contained three memorable action sequences , and jet , well , the poor dude was barely in the movie .
and i thought this was supposed to be his big break ?
how 'bout giving the slickster some more opportunities to show us his kung-fu fighting chops , slap him in a few more scenes , and give him more chances to practice his acting/english abilities ?
what a letdown .
even black mask was more entertaining than this glossed up , empty shell of a film .
in fact , i am sure that more time was spent gathering the " hits " for the soundtrack of this film , than were on the so-called " screenplay " .
i felt like i was watching a soundtrack rather than a movie most of the time .
the sad part about the bad script is that it would n't matter so much if the film actually had some decent actors spouting out the tacky lines .
but no , save lindo and aaliyah , who were n't too shabby , i thought the rest of the cast was picked primarily from their inability to deliver lines convincingly .
and what was the deal with the whole nfl franchise deal run by some 15-year old looking guy , acting like he 's the overlord of a drug ring ? !
what a mess .
then again , i do n't want it to seem like i 'm complaining solely about the story which was completely foreseeable , since we all go to see these movies for the action anyway , not the story .
well , i guess that 's what disappointed me the most out of this film .
there were a couple of cool fight scenes with li , but simply not enough to satisfy my overall craving .
also , as much as i love the way they incorporate wires and special effects in some of their stunts , a couple of the exaggerated fight scenes were simply too obvious a stunt .
it should be seamless , fellas , not necessarily against the laws of gravity !
the one cool thing that was original in the movie was the way in which the director showed us some of the inside cracklings of the human body when penetrated by a blow , but that simple creative touch could n't save the rest of this film 's uninteresting plot movements .
i 'm disappointed for jet li that this film did n't give him the real opportunity to star in a good story with many great action scenes .
hopefully , the next time will be a charm for this charismatic actor .
for now , i just hope that for his sake , the film 's title is n't a premonition of the movie 's ultimate fate at the box-office .

what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project .
most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films .
john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60 's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin .
screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd .
ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes .
even charlize theron , who i was convinced could n't act , did a decent job in cider house rules .
when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining .
after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration .
the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining .
the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are .
it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights .
we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar .
the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun .
reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors do n't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , does n't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest .
evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled " boy this movie is horrible ! "
and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments .
the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) .
nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and can not wait to leave prison and meet her in person .
when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays .
unfortunately ashley 's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship .
thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard .
now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel .
confused ?
the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax .
but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour .
the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley .
some hero .
the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire .
when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times .
the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason .
the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead .
the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food .
why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me .
why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .

what 's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie .
the garbage known as " snuff " films ?
nothing , right ?
what 's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ?
well . . . nothing .
so , why make it , hollywood ?
there 's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic .
no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this .
the lack of quality filmmaking in " 8mm " ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable .
but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again !
like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they 're few and far ( far ! )
between .
basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it .
why not walk out ?
well , this would n't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie .
here 's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of " 8mm " . . .
first thing--if you do n't heed my advice , then understand what you 're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud .
it 's not easy to watch .
i did n't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now .
the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator .
a rich old woman discovers a " snuff " film in her late husband 's safe .
she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , did n't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead .
she 's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find .
family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque " murder " .
let me backtrack for a moment .
see , " snuff " films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead .
however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and " good " acting make all the difference .
very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies .
the thought of this " industry " makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i 'll swallow my bile and move on .
welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry .
you 'd think he 's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him !
he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze .
after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , " snuff " films .
skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . .
led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer " machine " ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue .
the movie does n't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante .
this film does n't draw you in .
it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ?
it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie .
" se7en " ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) .
by those jabs , i 'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the " batman " franchise , but " a time to kill " was an immensely overrated disappointment .
for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled .
a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter .
writer andrew kevin walker did n't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , " se7en " .
director schumacher does n't have that innate ability to make you watch things you do n't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing .
he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we do n't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it 's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) .
however , gratuitous is joel 's middle name .
he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint .
no , he does n't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness .
he does n't leave much to the imagination .
it 's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante .
the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! )
craft .
case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? )
drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) .
see . . . no
subtlety .
does joel think we 're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ?
who do we root for in this mess ?
is there anybody out there ?
it 's not all the director 's fault , though .
why did the actors sign up for this ?
nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin ' out loud !
if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ?
what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ?
villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy .
and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ?
he was so solid as a concerned father in " a civil action " .
i guess ol ' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or
they 're suckers .
or they just do n't care .
there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland .
catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells .
baby cindy is obviously cute and wells ' devout love of his daughter is sweet .
the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter .
this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like " payback " ( which was a much better movie ) .
the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it 's rough .
during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts are n't good and whose timing was a half-second off .
such a technical error indeed stands out .
speaking of standing out , do n't believe the misleading trailers .
there 's not much action here .
occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe .
after seeing " 8mm " , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again .
is that a positive ?
well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they 've done a swell job here .
it 'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved .
but today i 'm not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ?
i 'm sure that somewhere right now there 's some pretty sick crap going on , but that does n't mean i need to know about it .
yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there .
yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster does n't look like we expect him to .
you said all that in 1995 .
move on .
this film serves no purpose .
it does n't entertain , it does n't teach us anything , it does n't make a statement beyond the obvious " this stuff is bad " approach .
only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile .
that 's not likely to happen , though , so " 8mm " is indeed a scummy waste of money .
orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , " to movies . . . to
good movies " .
if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole .
like " snuff " films , " 8mm " should never have been made .
now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it .
useless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme .
he used it in " batman forever " , in " batman & robin " , in " a time to kill " , in " falling down " , and it 's rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .

" easely one of the worst films of the year . . "
with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century .
this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil .
the result is somewhat predictable .
i did n't have high hopes about arnold 's " much anticipated " return to the big screen .
schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers wo n't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry .
everyone else will see 'end of days ' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture .
think of it as hollywood 's own y2k bug .
did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you 'll get 999 , as in 1999 ?
yes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days .
this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold .
he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc .
the way it works is he smirks and something explodes .
before the stroke of the new millennium he 's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations .
only schwarzenegger 's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him .
films like this has one serious weakness -- logic .
no matter how you twist the " plot " , you 'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) .
the incredible fact is that such directors never learn .
after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? .
here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution .
he is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius .
all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special .
but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter .
so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : " you can have your wife and daughter back . . i
can give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just
give me the address . . "
indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller .
and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger 's comeback , will not be very satisfied .
we 've not seen him in a while .
that 's because he did n't have a worthy opponent .
he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars .
he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop .
so , after all those fights , what 's left for arnold schwarzenegger ?
how about satan ?
in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron 's " terminator " .
and that is schwartzenegger 's strength -- muscles and no emotions .
here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar .
this is called " an adult turn " if successful and " a flop " if unsuccessful .
make a wild guess !
his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems .
this requires at least some acting skills .
regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles .
the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters .
the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting .
but the movie does n't serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) .
the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry .
the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular .
so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody .
unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away .
as for schwarzenegger , he 'll be back .
